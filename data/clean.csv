1,PupperinoSuprimo,1.0,"If you'll never really know, let that damn thought go.","Lately, this has become a sort of mantra Ive started using whenever I catch myself getting caught up and anxious over ""what-ifs"".   A huge part of   is obsessing over hypothetical situations that youll likely never confirm or disprove. You worry about what someone thought about you, or how they took that comment you made at lunch, or why that co- worker passed you by on the street without saying hello. Often, once that train of thought starts, its very easy to let it snowball and replay on a loop, reinforcing your  .  Truth is though, unless youre planning to approach those people and straight out ask them for the truth (which, lets face it, most if us with   are not about to do)  youre never going to know whether that hypothetical scenario is real or not. By replaying those negative what-ifs youre accomplishing absolutely nothing other than forcing yourself to watch an upsetting, imaginary scene over and over.  All it does is further fuel your  .    Ive been working on better ways to manage   for a while now and one of the most helpful things was finding ways to interrupt those thoughts and break the repetitive cycle of   inducing scenarios.  I thought Id share this brief phrase. Its a simple one, but something about the rhyming is soothing and helps keep it in mind  when I need an interruption long enough to calm down and redirect my mind to better thoughts.

3,ketchuptiles,1.0,Rolling anxiety attacks?,"Hey everyone,  I could really use your collective wisdom and experience on something Ive had difficulty in finding any information on.  In short, I get rolling   attacks. Instead of 10-15 minutes of intense panic, my   attacks last an hour minimum. However, more frequently than not they become somewhat permanent, lasting up to a month. And when I say they last, I mean my SUDS never dips below a 90, and I have constant racing thoughts, with pacing, lack of appetite, trouble sleeping, shaking and chest pain that starts as soon I wake up until I get exhausted enough where I can sleep again. I cant work because of it and my OCD.  I say rolling   attacks, but it actually feels like one long   attack. Im just trying to better articulate what happens since even my OCD specialist doesnt believe I experience them as I do because he says its physically impossible. But its like, I know what an   attack feels like, but for me they just keep going. I know something is misfiring in my brain.  This leads me to my question: is there another person alive out there who has some experience with this? Its been really difficult to find any information online whatsoever and Id like even a nudge in the right direction.",1554338312,1554338313,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b961fz/rolling_anxiety_attacks/,False,False,0.0

So I tell my friend that I was gonna get one, and she suggests I try Qdoba. I figure, what the hell, cant be much different, and maybe Ill like it more? They basically sell the same shit. Even though Ive had a pretty awful time trying to order from places like these because of the nature of them.  **Big fucking mistake.**  That was over an hour ago at this point, and I have no food. She was going to try and send me a gift of an entree. Well, the whole process broke the moment I signed up.  After I sign up I find out theres a refer a friend program. Only **you cannot use this whatsoever on an account that already exists.** So, I failed the process, on the first step. And now theres no way back.  You cant delete your account, so this is now permanent. Theres no tech support.  and even after all that, she cant even send me the goddamned gift because Id have to go order in store and pay for it there.

8,FreshAirFortCollins,1.0,"Parents of elementary school aged kids with severe anxiety, what coping plans do you have in place in school?","Last month my 10 year old was diagnosed with significant, but classic GAD. The severity of his   is also spilling over and causing depression, so hes dealing with a lot being so young (and without trauma being a trigger). Having   and depression myself for my whole life and our family being very aware of mental health, we were able to catch this pretty quickly and get him the treatment he needs. Hes currently seeing a counselor every week for CBT/coping cat and a psychiatrist has prescribed a couple of different meds until he gets farther along in CBT and has the coping skills he needs to overcome this.   Hes a month into his diagnosis and only a few weeks into his treatment. Were noticing school is pretty difficult for him. We are VERY fortunate that his teacher and school counselor are incredibly helpful, communicative, and supportive of him during this. When he has the first signs of an   attack, his teacher has him go to the school counselors office or the school psychiatrists office for a break and to work on calming techniques. Some of these techniques are playing games while talking about how hes feeling or taking a walk and talking things out. Were now frequently getting calls at the end of the school day to let us know what happened during his bad days and make sure were all on the same page and have actions in place to move forward. His school counselor is pretty awesome and were very thankful for that!   Were at the point where he needs to have an informal plan in place with a list of different coping mechanisms for him. He cant get on a 504 plan just yet because hes not at the therapeutic dose on his meds. Hes still working up carefully.  But, because hes so new in this, I have no idea how to help him at school yet. Hes so new to CBT, he doesnt have any of those tools yet either, like working on thought-stopping techniques. I feel like were in limbo where hes really struggling while all of this is getting started and its a slow process to getting back on track to stable mental health.  I know well send him with some clay because he uses that for his   tension in therapy sessions. Ive just downloaded the Whats Up app on his iPad and will have that for him to use when he goes to the counselors office (unfortunately, his iPad is kind of old and other mental health apps arent downloadable). And the walking will continue. Beyond that, Im lost as to how to help him. I know Im scrambling for anything because I know how utterly terrible it feels to deal with   and depression. I just want him to feel better and its hard that its a slow process.   Even though everyone has different coping techniques, I would love to hear what you have in place for your kids dealing with   in school. Thank you for the help!!

I have so much   and fear over my future. I remember I used to LOVE school and it was my whole life and I excelled and it was something I was good at, I am a first gen student and my family really drilled it in me that an education is of the upmost importance in life. My whole family is rooting for me and I feel like if I don’t succeed and graduate, not just graduate but graduate at the top of my class with honors and be the best of the best, all their struggle and sacrifice will have been in vain and I will have failed them and myself. When I graduated high school I took a semester off because I was burnt out but taking a year off in my mind would have delayed me and been catastrophic. I feel like that was a mistake I should’ve just started on time and I wouldn’t be behind, I feel so behind. I am getting my BS in biochemistry to go to PA school in the future, my coursework is rigorous and I’m SO tired I feel like I’m running on fumes and I don’t graduate until fall of 2020 the thought of making it that far seems impossible.  I would graduate PA school at 26, i know it sounds so stupid but I feel like I’m so behind and I’m wasting all of my 20s.   I can’t work during school I’ve tried but it just leaves me crippled with   and panic attacks and meltdowns because my coursework is so hard and I need to keep my grades up for PA school and employers are so not accommodating, so I have no money, I won’t have any money until I’m 26 it scares the hell out of me like what am I even doing? I have $400 to my name I live with my mom, I’m going to live with my mom until I’m what 28? Oh my god I will be almost 30 living with my mom, she’s a wonderful woman and my best friend and loves me unconditionally and would give me the world but I don’t want to live with her until I’m almost 30 years old. I want to live with my boyfriend of 3.5 years   I graduate then he graduates then I get into PA school and 2 years later I graduate and then I have to work and save money and then we’re 28 and we’re still dating but living with our parents. How miserable. Moving out isn’t feasible the city I’m in is $1200 without utilities for an “efficiency” aka a room in somebody’s house, it’s insanity but I can’t work so I have no money so I can’t move to another city  I could just not go to PA school but then what? What can I even do with a biochemistry degree I have absolutely no idea I only chose it because I wanted to get into healthcare and it fulfilled pre requisites while still being cool and fun but what do I do with that  If someone can offer some solace or advice or stories like mine that end well, please let me know I’m feeling at a loss here.

I’m back in tomorrow and Friday for my weekly 2 days. I have been reluctant to speak out about this as I’m only working 2x a week but it’s really affecting me. I basically work in an office based civil service enquiry centre. Whilst it might seem like an easy job (I can’t really go into details), but the decisions I have to make for the callers can genuinely change their lives and mistakes aren’t acceptable. It’s a high pressured environment as it is, but working there with chronic   is like hell. I’ve started getting chest pains from worrying so much about it and recently had a break down and ended up on a lot of medication. Also, my family and my partner’s family alongside many of my colleagues constantly harass me about not working there full time. The reason for this is that I used to go to uni Mon-Wed until I recently dropped out due to my mental ill health. I have thought about going full time but I can’t handle leaving the house and being around the general public for more than an hour or two so talking to people for 40hrs a week coupled with the stressful decision making, the likelihood of being abused on the phone due to the line of work and the pressure to interact with and banter with colleagues is too much for me. I’m actually getting weak knees just thinking about it. I feel so weak and other people are not supportive and tell me I’m just lazy and work shy. This makes me feel guilty so I feel like I can’t win. I feel like I don’t contribute to society and have been having suicidal thoughts at the thought of my family and others thinking badly of me. I can’t believe my life has turned out this way sometimes.. Anyway, I guess I just need to reassurance. I’m starting a new course for film and media in August which is more in line with what I want to do, so I know I’m taking steps to better myself and try to achieve my goals; however work and the pressure from everyone is cropping at the moment.

After a full mental breakdown at a full time night job I had at a hospital, I quit. I couldnt stay in college, my grades were suffering too much, every new job Ive tried I cant take more than a couple days. My last jib I quit on the third day, because my   was so bad I was passing out, and I hadnt even started my shift yet!  Ive been to doctors, I currently see a family doc, a therapist (twice a week), and a psychiatrist. Ive been evaluated three times, and have been medicated since I was 18. My parents dont really believe in mental disorders such as bad  , stress, and barely recognize my mood disorder. They were pretty abusive mentally and verbally, that was combined with neglectful tendencies.  I feel like I was set up to fail. Ive tried holding down jobs, I try so hard, but I can barely make a phone call without out stuttering and then having a panic attack afterwards. I tried work rehab, but the case worker made fun of me in the appointment and forced me into a panic episode. She didnt even stop when I started hyperventilating/crying/shaking. I ended up reporting her and leaving with no help.   My therapist agrees with me on applying for disability, but I have no idea where to start. I brought it up to my psychiatrist, but she never really addressed it. I was taught to never accept help from anyone, so being handed money to survive is kinda a hard thing to think about. But, my bf cant keep supporting the both of us. We are living paycheck to paycheck, and still barely surviving. Im already on Medicaid to pay for my doc appointments. Honestly, its killing me to let him provide everything for me.  I feel helpless, lost, and like a failure. My mother even told me straight to my face that my younger brother was better than me. That she was proud of him and disappointed that she couldnt say the same for me. Mind you, my younger brother is an alcoholic at 18, physically abusive, has done a hit and run, and respects no one. Talk about a loving family. I dont know what to do anymore.

I’m in my last couple months of school, and I’ve been suffering pretty badly with my   so I was recently put on medication to help me get to the end and then my plan is I’m going to come off them and do CBT over the summer.   I try not to take the meds unless I need to, though I do end up using them most days.   I’ve been taking them daily at the moment as this week I’ve been doing my first real exam spread over the week (because it’s so long) and I really struggle to stay calm in exams without them.   Today, I slept in, and forgot to take one.  Because I’m in sixth form I get free periods, so I slept in my car through the first two hours of the day (my frees) and forgot to take it again.   So I went to my exam and realised I hadn’t taken it because I started shaking. They take about an hour to kick in so taking one then would have been pointless anyway. So I did my best and got that part of the exam done, without getting too stressed. To be honest, I’m not sure how I managed to pull it off, but I did and I’m pretty proud.  But that wasn’t even the spectacle of today.  I had work tonight, and an hour before my shift started, I was leaving school, when I tried to turn my car on and it wouldn’t. Basically, I’d been listening to music without the car running and had the AC running, and killed the battery.   Luckily, I’d had the window down so my boyfriend could talk to his friend in the car next to us, and he heard my car sputtering when I tried to turn it on and stayed to help.   My boyfriend and his friend ended up pushing my car up and down the car park twice with me trying to bump-start it (which didn’t work) and then a teacher came out who luckily had cables and after about six attempts, we managed to jump-start it.   I didn’t even get a single tear-prick, god knows how. I usually can’t deal with anything if it’s going to make me late for work. I have a huge fear of disappointing people and usually even the prospect of it sends me spiralling into a panic attack. But somehow, I managed to stay chill, and it actually really helped us all be productive and work as a team to fix it. I doubt if I’d lost it I would have gotten to work on time.   So we managed to get it going again, and I was able to get to work *early*, med-free, and without a single tear.   I’m gobsmacked, and so so happy. I’m riding the high from today, something I haven’t felt in years. To a lot of people out there, yeah, sitting an exam and having your car battery die is stressful, but for my anxious self without her meds it usually would have been the death of me. So today has been an enormous achievement for me, and I couldn’t have done it without all the help from my friends.   I just needed to share my little achievement with you guys, so thanks so much for reading!",1554330727,1554330729,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b94pll/made_it_through_a_crazy_day_without_a_panic/,False,False,0.0

I’m late 20s female. I didn’t want them till someone I respect told me I’d regret it when I’m older and that for women, family is usually the centre-place of your life. All of a sudden I started questioning whether I want them or not, when all my life I was so sure I didn’t want them. I notice babies, children all the time in my life and in the media. It’s something I’m noticing a great deal now.   I’m so anxious about it. But I can’t separate whether I want them or not from all my fears. Fears of not having them and regretting it. Or fears of having them, not being able to afford them, being a bad parent, being stuck with the massive responsibility it is to raise them. Fears of not being able to find a partner that wants to be the co-parent, and becoming infertile before I get the chance.   And to top it off my boyfriend doesn’t want kids, so the   of do I/don’t I want them is heightened by the fears of having to leave the love of my life because our life goals would be incompatible.   I also am in an entry level job so I don’t make enough to support a child AND save for their education + retirement. Wondering if I should just not worry about that and whether having kids is worth the financial sacrifice/burden.   I’m an anxious wreck.

I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication (seroquel 100mg) which I’ve been on for about two years at varying doses.  Aside from that I’ve been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that I’m having investigated by a neurologist currently.  So, I’m seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel, and add a mood stabilizer. I’ve never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But, that’s another story.   Week 1 50mg of seroquel nightly  450mg of depakote   Week 2 25mg of seroquel nightly  900mg of depakote   Week 3 Stop seroquel  (Start 1/2 tablet of trazodone for sleep as needed)  Just wanted to hear positive experiences with depakote.

I am on a new lexapro prescription and have been for only 7 days now. In the last few days I’ve been having some pretty bad   and paranoia.   It’s going to sound a little crazy but here’s what I’m obsessing over right now. My boyfriend found a painting on the side of the road with a beautiful frame. He picked it up and put it in the car, it was in good condition and we thought we could salvage the frame. But ME, of course, decided it must have bed bugs and that’s why it was dumped. I made him throw it away but now I’m obsessed with the idea that we have bed bugs. I’m afraid his car has them and they were brought inside on our clothes. I feel itchy now but have no bites and he has no itchiness or anything most likely because we probably do not have bed bugs. I am able to think rationally but I also can not kick this idea. I checked the mattress 3 times today and my body feels pretty itchy and it’s really stressing me out.   I have had this happen to me before, at the start of my   and obsession over things I was convinced I had an STD despite negative tests and would check myself in the bathroom every 10-30 minutes at work or home.

44,Throwawayoftheday09,1.0,"Little bit of venting because I've felt absolutely horrible these past few days. Stress, sleep deprivation and anxiety have gotten the best of me once again, I think...","Last week I was bent backwards by a huge amount of stress over deadlines and where I built up a good amount of sleep deprivation. I had a group project that was failing for which I stayed at school till 9:30pm because my friend and I were the only ones actually doing shit, which led to me not having enough time to finish my individual project due two days later, for which I stayed up till 4/5am twice and I still couldnt get it done in time so now its not even gonna be looked at for at least until the resit... Then the weekend came and even though I have more deadlines this week (though much smaller ones) I decided to do absolutely nothing for school. Saturday was nice. I wanted to game a bit but ended up staying in bed till 2pm, then doing a deep clean of my entire room because it was a *mess*, then doing the cooking and after I cleaned the kitchen it was already time to go back to bed. It kind of left me with mixed feelings because I felt really good about finally having cleaned my room after postponing it for literally months but I didnt actually do the relaxing stuff I wanted to do... Sunday was a lot tougher because I had to work. I do tutoring and I planned two sessions of two hours right after each other because both students had their exams this week. It left me exhausted and I ended up not doing much after anymore. I just gamed a bit with a friend.  Then the week started and mayhem began. I have some thing we call seminars at my school where you  can (or have to) follow a two-week course organized by another study program within school, which allows you to expand your horizon a little bit. Its really nice and Im doing something incredibly fun but its super intensive. I need to wake up 6:50am each day for two weeks straight and then do a lot of physical work until 4/5pm. Add to that the sleep deprivation of last week, the two deadlines I still have to do for Friday, the usual stress of commuting 1:30 each way, and to top it off the   from all the groups we need to make (each day a new one so far) and the social aspect of it in general and I basically cant function anymore. I can do anything on automatic pilot mode but anything that requires thinking is out the question. I tried solving some problems yesterday for a cool idea we had but I just... couldnt. My head is throbbing with pain from a cold and from a neck ache thats likely caused by all the stress. When I get home I cant even play games because Im so tired, even though I get enough sleep right now. I cant believe this is normal...  Yesterday and today were just awful. Especially yesterday. Im getting all the negative thoughts back which had left me for a good few months. Its mostly unconditional self-hatred and its awful. I crucify myself for literally everything I do or dont do and I cant rationalize it. I hate on other people for things they did to me as if they were trying to hurt me, which they arent. I (silently) judge everyone for doing things I dont like (mostly things about myself that I recognize in others). And to top it off I dont even know if thats what Im doing because I know Im in a bad place so I tend to think super negative about anything I do and blow things way out of proportions. Maybe Im just making it all up.  Right now I feel like Im such a creep to some of the girls at that course because... I just look at them when they talk? I just feel so uncomfortable with the thought of ""oh shes pretty"" because I feel like anything I do will immediately be interpreted as being too much. But I basically feel uncomfortable with any thought I have or any thing I do in any context and with anyone because I feel like Im not being good enough to people around me or that Im giving a super bad impression. And half of the people at this course are actually normal classmates of mine. I dont know them super well but at least it brings some familiarity to the room, so that makes it even worse that Im so constantly worried about anything. Im kind of scared to show too much association with them because itll look like Im excluding the others but Im also trying to show that I like them (I dont really?) which will make me feel like Im excluding the others. I cant focus on anything positive anymore and I hate it... Even the objectively good things that happened today feel like bad things right now... Even when, as I was going home, I felt pretty okay... And I dont have any proof that it was bad, it just automatically is bad because some other bad things also happened. Today I also had that feeling of my stomach sinking and a deep, strong heartbeat several times on a single day while it happened like maybe once a week during the last couple of *weeks*.   I have many moments where I have a lot of doubt about whether I actually deserve therapy or even a diagnosis because so many people have so much worse problems than me (I know how cliché it is but its just true). I have many moments I feel like I dont belong with the general group of people with   because I can still go grocery shopping, hang with friends and get stuff done and its a feeling that never truly leaves me. Im in a constant cycle of ""you can do anything you want! So just stop bothering your therapist with your petty crushes and intrusive thoughts"" to ""huh this is weird Im feeling so good"" to a sudden ""well this is plenty proof I have  "" to ""this cant   but theres definitely something wrong with my mental health"" back to ""oh cool I was feeling worse but now its getting better again"" but at all those stages I have things I avoid like the plague and things that would give me immediate   if I dared thinking about them (such as imagining telling people (my therapist included) some things that (in my view) really make me look bad).

64,throwjaway2019,1.0,Anxiety at work,"Hi all,  Made a throwaway for this, because you never know, right?     So, where do I start... Im sorry if this is all over the place, but I need to vent and kinda write down how I feel and what issues I have.     Ive always felt like I was different than others. Social cues, etc, were never really obvious to me. I tend to overthink things, I dont get all jokes (I rarely make jokes because of this reason. Or maybe Im just not funny?). Although I can joke around with my best friends...  But in general Im doing fine I guess? I think most people like me, although Ive heard – when having those drunken conversations with friends and they become completely honest – that Im definitely kinda... ""weird"" is how they described me. As in, Im not super ""normal"", and thats fine, but not everyone can handle that or can get along with me because of that.     I definitely feel that: eye contact is not super easy for me with some people, especially not with strangers. Heck, Ive been working at my new job for 10 months and I still have issues in keeping eye contact with my boss. Its super weird and kind of annoying... I get super self conscious about it and I start noticing my facial features. Its weird. We get along fine and I dont think he really notices it, but I find it annoying.     Which brings me to the next topic, and is actually the reason why I made this thread.     Now, I work together with my boss – face to face – (its retail, but were focusing on the online at the moment). The others are all doing the retail jobs: sales, administration, etc, typical retail job. I dont come into contact with the others a lot. I do get along with most of them, but to be fair: Im the youngest of them all, and they really dont have anything interesting to say. That might sound arrogant, but seriously: you wont have any intelligent conversations with them (except with my boss). Theyve all been in retail for years and they sound miserable – plus they only complain and complain. Im just there to work and build my career with the online stuff, I dont give a rats ass about making friends with them.      Anyway,  theres this one guy (hes around 50 years old, Im 27ish) that keeps making jokes. Teasingly. Like, at my previous job there was also this one guy. Making jokes about you, trying to get under your skin. I know hes joking, and I know that the right thing is to ""joke back"", but its SUPER exhausting for me. Like, Im busy with other stuff, I dont have time to make jokes or to think of a great comeback. And because Im more of an introverted, serious guy, he probably feeds on it. He probably thinks my hesitance or lack of ""making a joke"" is some sign of weakness or something? Its just exhausting and I dont know what to do. There are a million things Id like to say, but frankly, I dont think its worth it? I just dont want to be offensive.  Theres also this new woman (40-ish) that joined, and shes also seeing my friendliness and kindness as a weakness, and I dont know what to do to make this obvious. Ive tried ignoring her requests but it doesnt really help? Im starting to think shes just too dumb to understand it.     The thing is, I dont know if Im overreacting or if I would be in the right to just tell her to fuck off and stop talking to me like Im a kid or her employee or something. I really want to tell that guy to just stop joking because hes not funny and to me, he seems like a miserable piece of shit trying to sound superior.     But again, Im not sure if I would be overreacting.     This post is all over the place, typed on mobile, but I hope you can kind of grasp what Im trying to say. Not sure if this fits in   either.

Okay, so I’m interested in getting back into counseling. Almost two years ago, after seeing my therapist for almost a year, I ended my therapy sessions abruptly.   I had attempted suicide but quickly realized I didn’t want to die. This attempt happened about a month before I stopped going to therapy and I didn’t want to tell her because I didn’t want to be hospitalized. (Stupid, I know).  Today, I am feeling a hell of a lot better than I did  when I quit therapy and haven’t thought about nor attempted suicide since.   I want to get back into therapy because I haven’t had a job in a while and need guidance getting back to working since I don’t have any current job references.   Not only the “having no job” thing but I just want to better myself in general and I really enjoyed working with her when I would go see her every week.  I was very open and honest about everything whenever I would go and see her but this is the one thing I never told her about.  I called her today to see if I could make an appointment and still have yet to hear back.  My question is, if I tell her about this past attempt (which again was almost 2 years ago), can she have me hospitalized? Not sure if this is a stupid question.   Again I want to reiterate that I haven’t attempted nor thought about suicide since two years ago. Honestly, I’m not even depressed nor do I have intense   like I used to, I just want to get back into counseling while things are already going well for me mentally.  I think it’s better for myself to get into counseling now while things are going well rather than wait until I fall back into a depression.  Any answers would be appreciated, thanks in advance     TLDR: I attempted suicide two years ago but haven’t thought about suicide nor have I attempted it since.

91,Milanc1105,1.0,"I hate seeing my friends happy now. (Sorry if the post doesn't make sense, I'm just finally pouring it out).","I moved to the UK in 2017 from Singapore. I had a lot of friends there and was probably what you would consider one of the ""popular"" people in school - always going out, lots of friends, parties, smart (I know I might sound snobby and cocky but I had all that back then). Now that I live here, I dont have any of that. I barely go out, I can count the number of friends I have here on one hand, I have never been invited to a party here and my grades have dropped so bad that I had to drop a year (grade for Americans). Ive visited Singapore twice in two years, and both times I blew over £600 (800 USD) in less than two weeks because I was out every night with my friends, getting fucked up, going for dinner, travelling etc. Now that I cant go back, I always see my friends doing those things without me every week. It frustrates me so much to see them be happy without me because I know I cant be with them. Its not just that they go out without me, its also that they never make time to talk to me because they are so preoccupied. Weekends have been so lonely for me because there is nothing for me to look forward to, not even conversation. I dont value my friends here at all like I do with people back in Singapore. This girl told me a secret that she hooked up with a guy in school who had a girlfriend and when I asked her why she would tell me that, she replied with ,""because I really needed to tell someone and you dont have any friends so Im not risking anything by letting you know"". This made me feel so shit because it was true. Im just some stress ball for her.  I cant tell my friends in Singapore that, they havent made time for me. I cant tell my mum, she lives in Japan ( nine hours ahead so time difference makes it difficult to talk) and I cant tell my dad. My dad is a weird guy, he is the reason we had to move to the UK against every hope that I had. My mum was in tears when she found out we had to move to London and so was I. I guess it isnt that bad for her, she lives in Tokyo with her family so she has friends and stuff to do. I just realised that I have less friends than my mum or my dad. Anyway, since moving here, my dad drinks everyday. One day, he started drinking at 8:30 am after having an argument over the phone with my mum because of his drinking habits. In an effort to secretly drink that day, he put his wine in his coffee mug. Shit place to hide such a smelly drink. The day before, he had come into my school drunk and picked me up in his car. The humiliation is unlike anything I have ever felt before. I had two choices: stay home the next day and hide from the embarrassment or go to school to avoid my dad. I chose the second option. He has embarrassed me on several occasions: turning up to my football match drunk and shouting from the sidelines, initiating a massive argument with me in front of my friends, driving me home drunk, calling me in the middle of class and getting angry when I dont answer, calling out my teacher in front of me and my friends, taking the piss out of the fact that my school recommended me to a therapist... the list goes on. He did all of this while drunk. Finally, karma got to him and he fell down from the top of the stairs, shattering his arm (the doctor said it looked like a crushed packet of crisps) and stopped breathing twice in 10 minutes. I thought this was an enlightening moment for him and he would finally recover. Nope. that was over a year ago. If I was at school that day, he wouldnt have gone to hospital. A part of me wish I went to school. A couple of months ago, my mum finally came to London but only for a short while. My parents got into a massive argument again but it was much worse this time. My dad started accusing my mum of slashing his leg with a knife (obvious bullshit because there is no scar) and then threatened us with suicide. Imagine your own dad saying that he was going to kill himself if we didnt side with him. My mum wants to seperate, I want them to divorce and I want to move out. But I cant do any of that for at least a year and a half. Im lost. I dont know what to do. All this time, my friends are just going out, having fun and doing whatever they want. They are even going on holiday to Thailand all together, except for me because Im still in school. I hate seeing them have fun now. Nobody has to reply, I just needed somewhere to vent. Trying to see if talking or writing down how I feel helps at all. Ive tried councillors but they dont help at all. They just somehow managed to make the conversation about themselves and change the subject. I do MMA to try and relieve some stress but that only works if I do well. Ive fallen out of love with football because its just so shit in England. I dont have any real friends to talk to here so I cant do that. Ive tried to run for executive positions within the school but that didnt work. Oh well, what can you do, hey? All I know is, as soon as Im done with school and university in England, Im getting out of this shithole country and moving to Asia. West aint best.

98,anon_anxiety,1.0,Throwaway because I am so embarrassed of myself..,"I will try to keep this as short as possible! I know a lot of this will sound silly but please bear with me. I (23/F) have been a merchandiser for 5 years, the work is in retail stores and I do resets, stocking, building displays, etc. I dont work for the stores themselves -I am employed by an outside company that sends me in to do projects for different clients. Heres the catch: I have always worked with either my mom or my boyfriend, they were employed with the company at the same time so we just did all of the work together and split the pay, the supervisors didnt actually care because it wasnt really ""against policy"" since we were all employed with the company. So while working I always had a ""buddy"" with me. I liked this a lot when we first started because I have always been deathly afraid of being kidnapped or assaulted, etc. My boyfriend has a new job as of 6 months ago so I work with my mom right now, the company isnt doing so well and the hours are dwindling to the point we cant rely on it. I started looking for a new job about 6 weeks ago because I have felt like I want more independence and of course a reliable paycheck! I applied to a handful of positions, I wasnt going crazy because it was important to me to work somewhere I would feel safe and preferably work during daytime hours with other people around, other people are a security measure for me and make me feel safer. I somehow landed an interview for a ""universal sales associate"" at a reputable and HUGE credit union in my town. Keep in mind I have never had a ""real"" interview before, the jobs I have had didnt really require it- as long as I was willing and able they hired you, haha. I prepared diligently for the interview, had my boyfriend mock interview me, I researched the company thoroughly, wore very nice clothes, I was as ready as I could be. I went in for the interview scared as heck, feeling like they wouldnt see ""me"" but a walking cluster of fear and  . It went pretty well I thought, but never having been interviewed before I didnt really know. I was contacted today with the offer letter/phone call. The pay is good, something I dont feel like I even deserve. The job sounds good albeit a bit confusing since this is a new position within the company. I want the job! BUT....on the phone the HR rep was talking about benefits/perks and I heard her say something about ""you are fully covered under our insurance for group travel for conferences, etc."" My stomach dropped when she said it, but I didnt interrupt or ask about it for fear of sounding like a weirdo. In the offer letter it also states this about the group travel thing, all the way at the bottom. Travel wasnt mentioned in the job listing or in the interview. Of course in my overactive mind I am thinking they are going to just throw me on a plane by myself across the country for some conference. I have never been on a plane, never traveled anywhere alone further than 40 minutes from my house and most of the time I shy away from going to stores alone because of the fear of human trafficking. SO.. am I blowing this out of proportion in my head? Is it common for banks/credit unions to send their employees all over the place all the time out of state? This is an entry level position to my knowledge, they know I have no banking experience of any kind. I want to ask the details of the travel but what if it makes me come off like a freak baby? I dont want my   to ruin this opportunity for me, I have pushed myself so hard lately and I want to keep progressing. I just am not comfortable with going somewhere far all alone and possibly having a meltdown in an unknown area. This was way longer than I thought- Im sorry!

110,busyanxiousmom,1.0,Increasing anxiety and not sure what to do,"Warning: this post does talk about postpartum, traumatic birth, and trouble breastfeeding if thats a trigger for you  TLDR at the bottom   Hi all, I am a lifelong sufferer of  . I was never diagnosed, but my mom has always had   and panic attacks and helped me to understand what these feelings were when I was younger. In high school my   increased and I began to have panic attacks. I guess I learned to cope because the panic attacks subsided as well as a lot of my social  , but I still deal with a lot of irrational  .   I am 21F, 7 months postpartum, and my   seems to be getting a lot worse. My pregnancy was easy other than   over becoming a mom and the possibility of a C-section (no reason to worry about this, normal pregnancy and no concerns, just anxious about it). I ended up getting induced for being overdue and was in labor for over thirty hours. Lots and lots of problems later I ended up with an emergency C-section and it was so much worse than I had worried about a potential C being.   My son was born perfect and is a healthy, happy little boy. The recovery from surgery was very hard though. My husband and I ended up having to stay in the hospital for 5 days. My son was unable to latch for a lot of reasons, so I began to exclusively pump breastmilk for him because I felt so guilty for wanting to give him formula and the nurses made me feel like garbage for even asking.   While in the hospital I felt like I was dying, turns out my hemoglobin was 7 and I needed a transfusion. I instantly felt better. We left the hospital and I continued pumping and trying to get my son to latch and was really having a hard time.  Four days after discharge from the hospital I was asleep and woke up unable to breathe. I went to the ER and had to be readmitted for two days for bilateral pleural effusion (fluid on both lungs), likely from the surgery and transfusion.  My husband and my six day old stayed with me overnight because I knew if I was away from my son my breastfeeding journey would be over. I was on diuretics which are known to dry your supply so I was pumping 30-45 minutes plus trying to feed every 1.5 hours.   Anyways, after being discharged I pumped for two months before switching to formula after my sons ped assured me he would be fine (side note: I really dont care if breast is best, the amount of pressure put on women to breastfeed when theres perfectly great alternatives is insane). This made me feel much better.  Its important to note that I do not feel that I have PPD and was evaluated for it and was not found to have it. My   increased for a while around the 3 mo. PP mark but went back to just normal, occasional  .   Now Im 7 mo. postpartum. My husband works full time and I work part-time third shift. I wanted to go back to school and my work pays 100% tuition so I reenrolled at a university in Jan. Now Im a student on top of this. My son stays with me during the day so sleep is limited. He is starting daycare but is on a wait list until July.   This past month my   has reached what I call crazy limits. Im doing things I know are irrational but it stops me from having a panic attack.  For example: the other night I was driving home from work (4:30A). My phone was blowing up so I went to silence it. My car swerved a little but not dangerously or anything like that. Even though I knew it was crazy, I was thinking what if in that split second I hit something (on an interstate?) And just didnt notice. So I looped around and drove fifteen extra minutes just to make sure I didnt hit a person or animal or tire or something.

So I am Going Through It, as many of us are.   has been through the roof, Ive been dealing with a new extreme level of depression since the end of last summer, and because of being underemployed and having chosen theatre as my career path (aka never getting paid for all the work I do outside of my day jobs), I cant afford therapy or really anything that might help lift me out of this well.  I am feeling really resentful towards theatremaking because it is \*exhausting\* and I feel drained and therefore not creative and so all my upcoming artmaking commitments feel like terrible obligations--even though Im the one that sought them out. And if I was in a better headspace, I would be so excited for them. But as it is, Im considering cancelling a reading opportunity I was given for early May because I cant get myself to write this play Ive been dreaming of for the last two years, and Im dreading an interview on Thursday for an amazing devising residency over the summer that Ive wanted to do for years.  Its all a mess. And Im starting to wonder if me holding on so tightly to theatre is part of the issue. In the past Ive felt like, my depression/  can take a lot away from me, but it cant take my art...but now Im wondering if I wouldnt be better off taking art off my plate, recentering myself as a human being, and then later on see if artmaking is still something that makes me happy.  But having said all of that (damn, sorry this is so long), I have no idea what kind of work would make me feel happy/fulfilled/not exhausted, if not theatre. My day job is an administrative type gig and I am grateful to have it, but I dont want it to become my life. I also currently live in a huge city, with a partner and a home and pets, and constantly dream of running away to somewhere totally new and starting over then.

Types of jobs/fields that someone with   and a lot of imagination could thrive in, instead of just survive through. Maybe yall cant even answer this. I guess its just, what would make me happy.

I feel more motivated with him, and always feel happy when hes around. He works and studies at the same time, so most of the time he cant talk to me because hes busy, and I do understand that. However, I still bitch about it for attention,  even though he spends almost all of his free time with me. And I hate to realize how selfish I can get to be. Hes literally the most hard working, good looking, caring guy Ive ever met (obviously he also has his cons). But he loves ME. Only me.  But why cant I believe it? Why do I have to doubt all the time, and always wait for the worst? Like hes going to get bored of me or that he could find someone better that doesnt cause so much trouble. Ive also tried to help him a lot, even though he doesnt always really need it (sometimes I wished he needed me more) and also he says that the connection we have is just mindblowing. We are a good looking couple and we get dorky when were alone, and sometimes I even KNOW what he is thinking. Literally.  I honestly have tried to change that insecurity shit, because I want a future and a healthy relationship (for once) with him, but these thoughts always come back. Im a sensitive woman. Hes more of a rational guy. He shows affection by giving me kisses, hugs, but somehow I still cant feel his warmth 100% and feel him a little bit like a robot. I still dont feel like giving 100% of my feelings like I did with the older guy who played with me or my first boyfriend. We have had a lot of discussions lately because we are constantly self conscious and he obviously feels when somethings not right with me.  Am I unable to love again 100%? I do feel a LOT about him, but I realize my feelings in general are not as strong as before (when I was younger).   He has dealed with all of my shit, like being rude, spoiled, and selfish. So I honestly want to do honor to my boyfriends feelings and his effort by allowing myself to feel the same way he feels about me.  Any recommendations?

153,SociallyGone,1.0,I went to the doctor for my anxiety today and it went terribly,"Hey guys, Ive been a lurker on this sub for a while now, but because of what happened today Ive decided to post this just to vent because it didnt go the way I hoped it would. Sorry about this long wall of text!  Just to preface this im 17 and have had social   and general   for years at this point and have wanted to get help for it, but... well, Ive been too anxious to :P. I always just said id sort it out later and just tried to avoid or deal with the  . This sub has been pretty helpful, especially seeing people who go through the same things that I do but recently its been getting pretty bad. About 3 days ago I started developing a ""tic"" which involves my head jerking back or to the side every couple of minutes/seconds depending on how anxious I am. I think this happened because Ive realised how close exams are and how unprepared/unrevised I am for them and other   causing things (like other people existing xD).    Anyways, my parents decided I needed to get this sorted out if its getting too bad, so they decided to make an appointment. I was already anxious because I only had one days warning which made me double anxious. Anyways, onward to my appointment, I was already anxious because I was in public and looked crazy because of my tic and also  I was at my normal doctor but I wasnt seeing my regular GP, instead I was seeing another doctor that I didnt know.  I waited in the waiting room for a while and then got called into the room (I was there with my dad so he came as well). When I went in there was a man in what I would say was his mid 50s, with a blank expression and judging eyes (lol). He was the most monotone and slow (as in the way he acted and moved) person I have ever met. Imagine the sloth from Zootopia mixed with a ""SHHHHH"" librarian and a sprinkle of judgement and dissmisiveness. I honestly think he may have been on some sedative/drug by the way he acted TBH.  I thought this appointment would be the ""Hi, what are your symptoms, does this happen ? oh you probably have this, do this and this to make it easier/ to help"" type , I guess not.   When I went in and sat down he just glared at me for a solid 5 seconds (why tho ?). For the next part ill be paraphrasing because I dont remember the exact things he said but ill try my best. The first thing he said to me was ""why are you here then"" in a bored voice, me being the anxious person I am just said ""well, im anxious, I think i have social   and general  "", he then said ""OK"" in the slowest and most untrusting tone Ive heard for a while. He asked me a couple of questions like ""what is your default state of mind"", again being anxious I said ""anxious most of the time"", ""What is your social life, do you have any friends?"", ""Non existent and pretty much no because Im too anxious to talk to people"". He asked about school and I said Im doing OK, but that its hard because I cant ask the teacher questions in class etc because Im too anxious and dont want to be looked at or else my face goes red and my eyes start to water and also all the other things that come with general and social  . At this point my face started to go red and I just blinked a lot so I was obviously visibly anxious (as well as the tics lol).   He then preceded to tell me that he ""cant do anything"" and that I should talk to a school councillor (my school doesnt have one) and maybe I should come back when Im 18 because I could then get adult counselling and also he wouldnt want to treat it medically. Probably the funniest part was when he said that I should ""look online"" to get some help. Wow thank you! I had never thought of that!!! \\s   The whole time I explained he had the blankest look Ive ever seen on a human face. The only thing he did was print of a sheet with some websites on like the Samaritans and 2 other websites and said I should have a look. The way he went to print off that sheet literally looked like he was doing it in slow motion though with how slow/tranquillised he was. He did talk about a place in my city where I could go to look for help which is in the town centre. Im pretty sure he didnt understand I would be too anxious to go there (my dad says hes gonna make me go there anyways :P). My dad asked about the tics and he said ""Its a physical manifestation of the  "" which was probably the longest sentence he managed to say about my   during this whole thing. Im sure I didnt do this conversation justice but just imagine the most ""whatever"" doctor and then imagine them being sedated with horse tranquilliser.  That appointment was full of loooong pauses which made it even worse. Anyways, in the aftermath Im pretty sure I dont want to go to the doctors again. My dad said hes going to get me an appointment with his doctor whos much nicer once Im 18 (in 1-2 months) but Im not sure if I want to. My dad agrees he was terrible so at least It wasnt just me. The only upside to this is that my mum contacted my school to tell them why I was off and apparently I might be able to get concessions (I think thats what its called) where exams are marked more leniently. Although my head of year is going to tell all of my  teachers whats wrong with me (I think they just assumed i was awkward) because I never told them but I havent in the first place because I never got a diagnosis ( technically still dont but I am not going to try to go back and go through that again, but he did say it was   at one point sooo) and also Im too anxious to.     Because of this, it has really put me off trying to get help if it will just make it worse than I started. I wish I was just a normal, non anxious human :P     Sorry if I over exaggerated at all, this  just happened to me so its probably gonna be on my mind for a while ;P. ATM i just feel defeated and sad. I really hope this doesnt come off as a pity post because I just wanted to vent. Anybody else gone though the same ?

161,Bipolar_Pigeon,1.0,I'm Just so Exshausted from Being in a Constantly Anxious State,"I have been diagnosed as having depression and   since I was around 13. I am 28 now, and have never received help for it. I was originally in the US, and my doctor would refuse to talk to me about options, or to refer me to someone that could help. I probably should have tried a different office, because I saw several different doctors there that would simply tell me I have these things, and then do nothing. I felt helpless.  In 2017 I moved to a different country, which has caused my depression and   to be on a whole new crazy level. I constantly feel like I am in ""fight or flight"" mode, and it is completely exshausting. The muscles in my body are always tight and hurting, and I am always fatigued. It has gotten to the point where I cannot leave my apartment by myself anymore. If I am with my husband, I am fine and can go outside no problem, but on my own it is a paralyzing fear. After *hours* of trying to fight through it, I have managed to go outside, and I am usually ok once I get out there, but I shouldnt have to psyche myself up for several hours just to go to the grocery store down the road.   In mid-February I started taking a French class. It was just for 8 weeks monday-wednesday in the evening. For the first half I went to every single class, and I was so proud of myself. I thought I was *finally* overcoming my fears. Starting last week though its like the door was shut in my face. I am right back to not being able to leave the house. I have missed several classes, and I am supposed to have a class tonight too. I want to go so badly, since there is just one more week left after this. By missing class I feel like Im being judged by the people there, and I will just sit in my chair in a paralyzed state for hours just trying to force myself to ""suck it up"" and go.   I am tired of living like this; it isnt sustainable. I am letting myself down, and even though my husband tries not to show it, I know Im letting him down too. He doesnt understand the   very well, so it seems silly to him at times, which makes me feel even worse. My family back in the US doesnt really know this is happening, since Im keeping quiet about it. I have no friends either, so I feel very alone most of the time. I want to be able to have a job, to go out and meet people, to go to the grocery store without fear, to just *be normal.*   A few weeks ago I made an appointment with my GP to find out who I should see for my   and depression. None of the Psychiatres she is associated with know English, so its up to me to find one. She did give me a paper, which I guess is sort of a referal, to give to whoever I end up seeing. Im scared though. Im afraid of not being taken seriously, or that my problems arent severe enough to receive help. I know its silly, but I still feel that way all the same.

I’m just to broken hearted about it. The only person I have and can rely on in myself, everyone else always cancels or completely ghosts me when theres previously arranged plans.

Its like theres this huge sign hovering above me telling people to stay the fuck away. I’m starting to accept that I’ll never have any friends, and Ill be alone forever.

I had a really good week and got to do a bunch of stuff I had been putting off. I was feeling confident since there wasnt too much to do in the near future. So I didnt know what my next thing should be. We agreed that during these three weeks I would get back to working out and figure out what to work on next.  The appointment is coming up next week, I have not started working out yet even though I want to. And I have no clue of what to take up next time.

Now Im experiencing   symptoms again and Im very upset about it. Im fine while Im at work (distractions are key, I guess)..its not until nighttime when I feel it. Dry mouth, shakes, mainly having   about having  . Although when I start to experience the shakes I do prevent myself from having a full blown fight/flight situation. I can somehow control that but I dont know if thats good or bad? I had 2 crying spells last night while talking to my friend about it. (I avoid talking about it so I wont have think about it) Also, the worst part is - I cannot sleep. Im experiencing a weird situation where Im about to drift off into a nice sleep but my   will wake me right back up. Its like my brain doesnt want me to sleep. Its the kind of sensation you get when you are sleeping sitting up and your head falls to the side and you jerk it back up. Has anyone ever experienced this? The past 2 sleepless nights havent been fun. Ive tried the mediation apps, they arent really working for me. My body/brain is still waking me up once I drift. I even went back to gym tonight (after months) and did cardio for over an hour to tire myself out and came home and took Melatonin with no luck :( I took 200mg L-Theanine yesterday morning and I feel great (could have just been exhaustion and coffee, though) Because when I took another 200mg pill around 5pm, I felt nothing. I also took a 250mg of Magnesium Cirate and still did not help me fall asleep with ease. (P.S. I tried magnesium glycinate yesterday and it made me super sick)   I hope Im not alone on this strange sleeping problem. I dont know how long I go on with this, Im thinking of just going to a psychiatrist. Im just really disappointed that I let myself get like this again. Should I just go see a doctor? I really dont want to be on medication but its truly a struggle. Any advice or suggestions would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!

When I was a child (I  do not remember how old I was ) but i was entering 6 grade, a normal day, but something in a way that I do not remember changed in me, that first day of school I started to feel afraid, drowned, desperate, I just wanted to go out crying and be with my mom.

(maybe sounds funny but it was real).  During my high school was totally different because the  , the fear and the desperation never manifested. I think high school was my best years.   On university the problem came back, worst than ever. Im about a month away from graduating.   Now im 23 old, today I woke up from bed because I start feeling   (its 2:30am where I live) desperate And I started having suicidal thoughts.

It comes out a lot in social situations and also at work when talking to people especially of higher ranking in meetings.

I played sports throughout my childhood and high school and never had issues but my   has crippled my sport playing ability to the point I look like someone who’s never played in his life. I either overthink everything (throwing, catching, batting) so it doesn’t come out right, or my heart just races uncontrollably, my stomach feels like it’s sinking, and my legs shake and my mind just won’t turn off (pleas god don’t fuck up) thoughts. I noticed though if I’m randomly having a good game, the   subsides a bit. But as soon as one bad play happens, it dominos badly and it just gets worse from there.  Tonight was probably the worst of all. 1 for 3 batting, already had a dropped flyball and with 2 outs, ahead by 1, bases loaded......I drop the easiest flyball hit directly at me. As the ball came to me I literally just panicked, made contact, and it just bounced off my glove. We lost. One of the most embarrassing moments of my life and the team wouldn’t even look at me after.   I think I’m gonna drop out of this league as I’m embarrassed to even show my face after this. Sad part is, playing catch with one friend or going to batting cages, I do amazing. But as soon as I’m in social setting,   comes and I can’t play whatsoever.

Husband went to work, his gout flared up and he had to call in one day because he couldnt walk only that evening to find out that the shutdown basically was going to keep him home for awhile. Then he gets better, and gets a nice interview where things sound great and we both got the Flu. Then, once we both got over the flu, things start looking like it is going to pick back up and he gets gout AGAIN in both knees and feet. I guess I should have explained when he gets gout, I have to take over all the errands and whatever running has to be done. We have no siblings at all, his parents are dead and mine....well they wouldnt piss on fire to put me out. So it all fell on me. Then the gout clears up, he goes to the Dr and we find out that he is looking at Stage 2 Kidney failure which is causing these gout flare ups so to speak because his kidneys arent pushing the uric acid out of his system like they normally should be doing. I made a decision that he doesnt need to be the one worrying about working and I start applying to every single job I can find like a madwoman.   I got a nice job starting at the end of the month and we are so close to getting everything lined out. Only problem is I am worried that something is going to throw a monkey wrench in everything yet again. It seems like we have the worst luck in the world. We are waiting for his check to come in so we can get the tags renewed on the car and get some food in the house, not to mention get us moved from where we are right now.   All this mess even though its a good mess right now, is causing me to worry and stress because I am scared that something will go wrong. I know its life, and life is never fair but for once I would like to have a break. I would love for the check to come in tomorrow (which I know it wont, it will be early next week I think), and us be moved within the next 2 weeks. We are simple people and dont have much to get moved so it wont take but maybe 1 or 2 loads of stuff to go to a new place. We will have plenty of money but my goodness I wish that stinking check would come in already.

187,4--0--4,1.0,Persistent Anxiety Over Drunk Sex,"Hey guys, first post here. If people are triggered by suicidal thoughts, alcohol abuse, or drunken/sleepy sex, perhaps give this one a miss.     This is something that has really worn me down. Basically, at a party I threw my ex and I got very very drunk. I had to carry her up the stairs, in fact, and dump her on my bed. She often needed carrying after nights out just because she didnt want to walk anywhere, or because she wanted to doze or whatever- she was a real lightweight.     Anyway, the issue is that being extremely drunk and in a committed relationship where we both got super drunk every week and had sex after nights out, sometimes multiple times, I initiated sex with her, kissing her neck and generally trying to arouse her. I remember thinking there is no way I would do this with anyone else as they might not like it, but its ok with her. Kind of like how in the middle of the night youd wake up your SO by doing similar to have sex. She was moaning and seemed awake but very sleepy, eyes shut- basically, about to doze off. I did most of the work in getting her undressed, as she was basically out of it. Remember at this point I am also hammered beyond belief. She rolls over a little, and then it gets hazy. I remember more kissing and rolling around on my bed, and the feeling of being in her as she moaned in her normal way- i.e. not a way that suggested anything wrong- and then having sex hard on the floor (something we did occasionally).     Now, remember, this is my   riddled account. A couple of days after, she asked me if she had indeed needed carrying up- I said yeah, cause she was barely able to stand (I think- am not actually sure-shed taken a seat and walking her proved to be difficult, especially with the steep stairs, so I think thats why I carried her up). Then she asked if anything else happened she would want to know, so I told her a couple of other things then that wed had sex for hours. Her response was ""hours"" (as a joke, I assume) and then to say that she hoped no one heard us.      Fast forward a year or so. Weve split in unrelated circumstances. I have to help a friend home in similar circumstances, and it gets me thinking of that time. So I begin to obsess. The details in my head change constantly, and I keep scouring reddit for help- but then I get this notion locked in my head that Ive raped her, as thats the response you get when you type in my ""bf had sex with me when I was wasted"" into google. Now, heres the bit that fucks with me. I was freaking out didnt eat or sleep for nigh on 24 hours and had been drinking the night before, and contemplating ending it all, so I called my dad who called her (I dont have her number to hand, but he has my old phone at home). He explained the situation to her and what I was afraid of, including details such as the date and the location, and she was apparently very polite and sincere in saying she thinks our memories differed and that she was awake and she was fine (I only ever threw one party at that house). Obviously this helped immeasurably...at first.     Ive fallen into a pattern of constantly needing reassurance, either from my current gf, my dad, or from arbitrary things like coin flips.

Ive been cleaning, cooking every day, packing him lunches etc, just to try to be more helpful and put less stress on him.  But hes withdrawing really hard and it scares me. Hes always been a bit introverted and quiet when it comes to conversation, but he said maybe three sentences to me today. I asked him if everything is okay, and I can see it written all over his face that its not. Ive been with him for 13 years and I can tell when something isnt right. And tonight was the first time he wouldnt talk to me. I didnt try to push him into talking, but I did express my feelings about him hardly speaking to me, and now I feel like an asshole because I just added to his stress.   And of course with the  , my mind is jumping to the worst possible scenarios. His job in the military has one of the highest rates for suicide, so Im worried about that. His withdrawal from me makes me think he wants to leave me. Just a constant onslaught of horrible things running through my mind, and I can feel the pressure building up in my chest and head.

189,JustinVincent,1.0,I feel a bit abnormal.,"I’m 16M, and might delete this post later.  I don’t know why, but I feel like everyone acts different to me in an odd way (including my family). I’ll just say this shortly. Whenever I try to talk to my brothers, they’ll ignore me or say something like “that’s cool” afterwords, or when I show something that I find amusing (like memes or a dumb vid), every single time they”ll say “that’s funny” with a straight face, and my mom will talk to me with a high pitch voice all the time. Other people besides my family, they just kinda ignore me. It feels like I’m been treated like an 11 year old.  I never see my brothers act different to each other, I’m the only one. And there friends are completely chill when they hangout, it’s the opposite for me.  Maybe I’m overthinking it, but it’s making me feel self-conscious and anxious 24/7 and have no clue what to do.

190,boxed__water,1.0,I keep getting thoughts that I'm not as loved or appreciated as everyone else in my main friend group. It's gotten to the point that I'm starting to detach emotionally and push myself away.,"Im not sure if this is relevant, but Im 17 and my friend group consists of people ages 15-19. Ive been diagnosed with Generalized   Disorder, and have had [Selective Mutism](https://selectivemutismcenter.org/whatisselectivemutism/) (SM) since I was 4 (wasnt diagnosed until I was 7 or 8).  Back in early September of last year I was added to a Skype groupchat by a family friend (15F, nickname KT for privacys sake) of mine, who I considered my best friend at the time. Being someone with SM, I couldnt talk to them. It wasnt until about a month and a half later that I finally spoke (which is the quickest Ive ever spoken to anyone--before then, it was one year, though the vast majority of people in my life havent heard my voice in 12 years). I was already pretty close to them before I spoke, but talking brought us even closer. We were a tightly-knit family.  Now, its April and we dont have as many group video calls as we used to. KT and I arent as close, as I have come to realize how toxic of a friend she is (I dont want to cause drama, so I havent done anything about it). Were all very active in our iMessage groupchat (which, surprisingly, all 20+ of us have an iPhone), and continue to regularly share memes on our other groupchats on Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. Im pretty sure we have a Discord chat, too. Many of us have already met (all but about 3 of us live in the same state). We have another group meeting planned for next week. Everyone within the group has their own tiny groups (some simple pairs because they live extremely close to one another, others small groups of a few people for aligned interests), though we all remain as one giant friend circle. We make the long distance work out, and theres hardly ever any drama.  However, because I have   and SM has hindered me from experiencing the average persons social life, I can barely hold a conversation. I rarely talk to any of them one-on-one. The ones that I do talk to, though, rarely do or dont give me the same excitable energy I give them. I understand that phones go both ways, but Im aware how many of them easily text each other outside the main groupchat. In a group of 20+ people, how could none of them have bothered to text me once? There are some who I text first, yet dont get a response back from.  I started to overthink it, and took a small break from the groupchats (I was added back almost immediately, though). Because leaving didnt work, I muted them and havent taken a look at what theyre saying. I know it doesnt seem like a big deal, but I even removed emojis from everyones names (except for one person, though I never text him). I emotionally detached, and dont feel the same joy I used to get when I see any text messages from them (after leaving, a few reached out to me privately).  This sucks a lot because this is the kindest, most drama-free friend group Ive ever been in. Theyre my family and the only people I talk to these days (aside from family). As mentioned before, theyre my main friend group--in reality, theyre my only friend group. I dont want to lose them because I keep doing these things. Im sabotaging myself.

My kid learned to drive but not without denting both my cars (not expensive cars but still, and I aint fixing them because its like 4k)     My sibling moved to another state.       My mother is at the bad end of dementia.  This means both that Im loosing my mother and that Im spending my spare time with her and learning a valuable lesson of life.     I had a major leak in my home, it cost me 20k out of pocket.     I caused a major upheaval at work due to getting a little depressed about the other stuff - I even threatened to quit.  Now I feel like a mouse coming to work and Im not sure my job is stable.     Due to the above I went from 30k in debt to 65k in debt.

194,gbthrowawayacc,1.0,Can’t sleep because of a debate with my roommates (it’s been 2.5 hours),"It was a really stupid debate about Elon Musk.  Nonetheless the debate led into me talking about marketing (my major that I’m graduating in 1 month with).   I left that debate feeling pretty peeved. I felt like they weren’t wanting to here me out, and that they wanted to tell me what my own major was. They boiled my major down into advertising and social media. At that point I quit debating because it was obvious that their points were coming from a place of ignorance on the very subject we were debating.   It’s not the first time they’ve made comments about my major being “easy”. Sometimes they’ll see the median salary for a digital marketing job I’m applying for and say, “YOU CAN GET PAID $X JUST TO TWEET?!” Obviously digital marketing encompasses a TON more, especially in the last couple of years. It’s just really annoying when they say that kind of stuff.   I’m graduating from a top business school with my degree, and it makes me feel like I wasted my major even though I love it. Marketing is kind of a misfit in the business world because it melds together data and creativity. I just think the creativity side makes people discount its difficulty.   Part of me just needed to vent because I know it was stupid but I am still hurt and stressed about it. I’ve been up for 2.5 hours exclusively thinking about it. I just want support and open mindedness from my friends to learn about the basics of my passions. Instead it’s just assumed they already know. Ugh. I need to leave this spiral.

My favourite place to monitor my heartbeat is that bit in the middle of your neck, between the collarbones ( I have a feeling this isn’t at all a good place to measure ).   I had no other symptoms at this point, just the feeling of heart palps. It took everything in me not to wake my mum and beg her to take me to hospital ( Again ). I have been tested in the past and got the all clear. But my brother died of sudden adult death syndrome and I have had a blood clot in the past where I’ve had to have brain surgery.

Also Ive got the hospital in two days because Ive been having a pain in my eye/head so of course Im thinking the worst about that.   How do you guys stop yourselves from overthinking? Currently watching parks and rec after turning it off before going to bed (then having a panic attack so put it back on) Im in one of those horrible ruts where Ill jump to conclusions and think too far in the future like what I mentioned about having work tomorrow.

In the last couple years Ive been finding myself and trying to get over my   and not let it rule my life. So Ive had Tinder for around a year, since I never meet anybody in real life, and Ive met a few people through it but nothing ever got past 1 date, and once a heavy petting session. All the people Ive met were dudes so far.      All my life Ive had the inkling that Im either Bisexual or Gay, kinda leaning towards Bisexual with heavier attraction towards women, but Ive been so intimidated my other women romantically for some weird physiological reason Im not sure off, I kinda think its because they are all so pretty, and Im self conscious about my looks, (Btw, I dont think Im ugly at all, in fact most of the time I think I look pretty good, but compared to all the beautiful women I see, I just feel homely in comparison).     So today I met up with a guy from tinder who recently graduated from my college and lived near by, it was awkward and I bailed out after 20 minuted claiming lots of essays to write. Im proud of myself because a year ago I wouldve let the night drag on and wasted my time because I was anxious of taking any initiative.     Anyway the thing Im really exited about is soon Im meeting up with a girl I matched with on tinder, she lives on campus and is so pretty!! she will be the first girl Ive ever met up with in romantic contexts, and Im pumped. We chatted a few times over the last couple weeks but it always fizzed out after a few minutes, but tonight I just went for it and asked her what she was doing tonight, and if she wanted to get high and get pizza with me. Its the first time Ive ever took initiative like that, so basically the first time Ive ever asked someone on a date, or ""to hang out"". Im not sure if I would have had the courage in person, but whatever. I really hope my temporary courage becomes more permanent, and that I have some fun tonight! I ll totally update you guys tomorrow morning if anything comes of it. Im meeting her in like 10 minutes, so wish me luck!

231,medsfourdays,1.0,Panic Attacks Are Back :(,"I’ve struggled with Panic Attacks since I was 18. I didn’t start having regular ones until I was 20. I never noticed the   I had even when I was younger until these started happening. I’ve always been anxious in social situations ever since I was in elementary school and then I went into a career field that forced me to interact with complete strangers regularly (EMS). This is when they started coming on regularly.   I was put on 0.25mg of Xanax as needed (never took it while working) and then the Panic Attacks started to change, the symptoms changed and I would legitimately feel like I was going crazy. I was having them pretty much every day. I started seeing a Psychologist, at the recommendation of my PCP, because I hated being on meds. I was diagnosed as having Panic Attacks with Agoraphobia.   As of May 2016 I haven’t taken any   meds like I was before (except when I needed an MRI). I thought I had learned to successfully stop them and it worked up until January this year.   On my birthday, I had some kind of an allergic reaction to my cake and woke up to a swollen upper lip but no other symptoms (so, it could have been too much sodium that caused it too). 4 days later I ate the same cake and within 10 minutes I thought I was going to go into anaphylaxis. I was freaking out and could not stop it no matter how hard I tried.   Since then, I’ve had a handful of times now where I’ve eaten something that is not new to me and freaked out thinking I was starting to have symptoms of anaphylaxis. I am completely rationale in my thought process. I KNOW I am not allergic to these things but I still go into a full Panic Attack most of the time.

234,dumbledeer,1.0,"Anxiety and big, big decisions","*TW: talking about relationships, religion, and internet friends*  So, fair warning, my life is stupid complicated right now so Im going to really ramble a bit. Honestly, just getting this out there and off my chest is what I really want more than anything... so dont feel obligated to respond, my anxious brain just needs somewhere to go besides my journal right now. Alright, lets get the garbage fire started!  Its come to my attention that   has been silently ruling almost my whole life- ever since I was a kid. I was raised in a.... slightly chiller version of a cult so I always assumed/was told it was like, demons or my own mortal doing or a test to prove the glory of powers above but turns out, its probably the   that runs in my family. That out of the way, Ill try and summarize my problem:  I was 13 or so, had a best internet friend, and was under the impression that this was a terrible, horrible sin, and had many, many, many terrible panic attacks until I broke down and told my parents, and cut contact with the girl. I was her only friend, and my sudden disappearance and occasional attempt to contact her when away from home wrecked her *badly* and I was a mental disaster as Id never been so close to somebody in my life. We got in contact again when I was 15 ish but I ended up breaking down again (even worse this time, burned all my possessions too) and... same pattern. Long story short, I ruined her life for that bit, leaving her confused and heartbroken... because Im pretty sure we were in love? At least it damn well felt like love. I felt like, so much emotion every time I thought about her and my brain made every book, song and plotline about her in some way. Which is a whole different can of worms because Im not a guy. SO ANYWAYS. This summer, we ended up talking again because her best friend found me online, and weve started healing and talking through the whole crazy mess and are, by some miracle, best friends again- I even MET HER in real life, thank god!! Im unbelievably happy to know that were in each others lives again. But.  My  . Is. Killing me. Because heres the thing. In my head, after I had freaked out the second time, I sort of... made a fantasy where we *were* in love, right and would think, ahhhh if only things had worked out, its just a shame, etc etc. But... now Ive made it. But were different people now. I know for a fact she believed we were soulmates, she told me this while we were talking, and I know all she wants in life is a girlfriend/wife (shes a classic disaster lesbian) but... I dont know. Im so hesitant about it and I want to move on so badly! Because as much as a part of me wants that fairy tale ending and everything to be perfect, she is... a different person than the kid I knew and imagined all those years, and she feels emotions so strongly in a way that triggers *my* panic attacks and I just dont know how to rewire my brain for some damn peace about it. I feel so responsible for her. My   screams ""if you dont love her romantically, shell literally die and it will be YOUR FAULT!!"" which is irrational, obviously, but so scary to me.   I just want her to be okay more than anything but I cant afford to pretend . How do you move on from what you thought you wanted more than anything? It felt like the plot of my whole entire life, and now that Im not sure it is, I just feel... scared.  So... yeah. Thats my situation? Im a senior in high school and Im honestly just trying to stay sane between the cult trauma,   attacks and making sure my friend is *okay*.

I’ll give you an example or two.  I went to the doctors after somewhat telling them about my   and such. They told me that one of the reasons I could be tired and fatigued all of the time is due to having anaemia or asthma. So I took a blood test.  The results were simply that I didn’t have enough Folic acid or Vitamin D levels, so I was prescribed medication to balance these levels. Upon not hearing that it was anything serious or even just anaemia, I got really upset.  I can’t explain why but I always feel like this. A strange desire to have bad things happen to me.

Also recently Ive become really sensitive to small things. I might go into that in some other post but like if somebody even mentions if somebody doesnt like me I freak out and just feel terrible. Last thing Im also kind of just want to be mean and judge people. Its terrible but it becoming kinda mean and I know a lot of kids think Im bitchy. I like to have a sarcastic sense of humor and I will be pretty rude and then play it off like Im just kidding. but Im kind of not. Its so bad because i dont want to be that bitchy kid I want to be nice like I really am. For instance, this kind of mean jock kid became friends with a close friend of mine so I did a bit of digging. I lie found out his mom used to be an ex-alcoholic and he used to be addicted to drugs but quit. He kind of has never been nice to me and a bit homophobic in the past and Ive had the urge to just mock him for having a shit home life. Idk I have   and   too so Ive gotten panic attacks because Im imagining the terrible person I could become. Also see the background is pretty popular at my school for being the gay one and Im pretty funny and outgoing but, most of the guys dont like me so a lot of my friends are girls which I used to get bullied for. After that, I just hate certain people and felt the need to like seek revenge I guess. but im not violent or anything. Anyways that my life hopefully someone could help me out.",1554250105,1554250108,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8qyx5/handling_others_descisionsgrowing_up_i_guess_oh/,False,False,0.0
245,Jan242004,1.0,I fainted today at school because of anxiety in Spanish class,I do not speak Spanish fluently and am barely capable of having a conversation with someone in Spanish but am pretty good at reading to it and listening to it. The teacher today announced that we would be doing improv which meant no papers whatsoever. I started to panic a bit but calmed down when she said we would have 20 minutes to practice. However the person I was supposed to practice with is also not well versed in Spanish and she started getting panicky as well. I really started to freak out but then the teacher announced that we would be completely switching partners after and I ended up with someone who is quite good in Spanish. I tried to do it but couldn’t and eventually started tearing up and couldn’t control myself. My friend and I left the classroom and went to the washroom where I started hyperventilating and eventually fainted. The next part I only know from what I was told but she apparently ran out to the hallway to get my teacher who came and rubbed me awake and she also got our Vice Principal who is in charge of this sort of thing and I lay on the floor 10 minutes with my friend and her. Meanwhile my teacher left and proceeded to tell the entire class that I was crying because I was stressed out than after I fainted told the entire class I fainted which kind of pissed me off. Anyways after they sorted it all out the vice principal called my dad who was less then thrilled to have to pick me up. I’m thinking the teacher may have gotten in to some sort of trouble possibly because I saw her talking with our principal after while he was taking notes and I overheard heard him talking about it with the vice principal. We took home my friend as well because we where at school for longer than expected. Just looking for tips for afterwards. I’m not looking forward to all my teachers finding out and for what the teacher is gonna say to see me on Thursday when I have her again.,1554250002,1554250003,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8qyao/i_fainted_today_at_school_because_of_anxiety_in/,False,False,0.0

247,meetmeonthestarferry,1.0,Terrified of growing up and not sure where to turn.,"As a child, I was so eager to grow up and act like an adult. I tried to grow up way too fast. Now that Im 27, I just wish I could go back to being a kid and being under my parents care. I know how bizarre that sounds.  I graduated from college early with a Bachelors degree and strong GPA, I have a full-time job and live in an apartment with my boyfriend. Outwardly, I look like a decent success, I suppose. But I worry that this is my plateau. The thought of buying a house makes me feel like I could throw up. The thought of getting married is terrifying. I do hate being the center of attention and I think that the thought of marriage scares me in large part because I hate, hate, hate being the center of everyones attention, having parties thrown for me, etc. Cannot stand it one bit.  I am getting sick of living in an apartment and having to share parking spots and common areas with other people who dont care as much about their space as I do. Id like to get married, I really do want to. I love my boyfriend - he is everything Ive dreamed of in a guy. Hes smart, hilarious, caring, and a really hard worker. I couldnt ask for anything else, and yet Im so terrified of taking the next step. But I do want these things so bad, I am just so anxious. I overthink every decision and Im going to let life pass me by.   I feel like I need to talk to someone I trust about these things, but Im so terrified because any time Ive expressed hesitation to the people around me, they say, ""Well, clearly hes not the right guy if you arent down right excited about buying a house with him and getting married."" But I strongly disagree with that. I dont ever want to break up with him and hes so great. Breaking up with him and finding someone else is not the answer, because if Im lucky enough to find another person as great as him (which, to be honest, I dont know that I could), Ill end up in this same nervous position that I am now.  I also need to recognize that Ive NEVER been excited about any life-altering decisions, even the ones that have been so amazing. Choosing a high school? Terrifying, didnt feel satisfied with my choice in the beginning but it turned out fine. College? I absolutely DID NOT want to go. The thought of moving out and leaving my parents nagged at me. That first weekend of school, I sat and cried in my dorm room. But once I finally took the leap and started making friends and going out? I was in heaven! Any time Ive switched jobs, Ive had horrible nerves and   about it. But this most recent job I took was probably one of the best decisions for my mental health because the company and the job is so, so much better than where I was before. I never think, ""Hey, that was such a good decision!"" until well after the decision is made. Up until making the decision and even for a bit after it, Im thinking, ""Shit, think of all the things that could go wrong. This is probably a massive mistake.""  So what am I going to do? I feel like these feelings of terror and   say to everyone else that I must be in a bad relationship, but Im not. Im never going to get over these feelings no matter who the person is. I feel like I suck, I feel a bit worthless honestly. I dont know what to do from here. I feel so stuck where I am right now and like there is no way out.",1554249154,1554249154,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8qt3l/terrified_of_growing_up_and_not_sure_where_to_turn/,False,False,0.0

255,PM-Me-Your-Bears,1.0,"Is this feeling ""Anxiety""?","Greetings   I wanted to post this here to collect my thoughts and hopefully get some external help understanding what exactly this feeling in my chest (metaphorically) is. I read over the posting rules and hopefully none of this violates it. Im not asking for a diagnosis but rather I wouldnt even know how to describe these feelings to a professional if I did seek help.  I recently found myself in an odd position where I have a mental health *issue*, but its not really an emergency issue. For context: I am in my mid-twenties and have happily been in a long term relationship since I was 16. I also had a rather (emotionally) rough childhood between regular school bullies and an unsupportive father figure that, when combined with the fact that I never really had the chance to explore myself or date others, I dont really have a lot of experience with ""Exploring myself"" emotionally. I would easily say Im a little stunted on my emotional growth due to these circumstances, which is why Im so confused about my situation or even how to describe it. So, *heres my problem*:  *I am a self-control freak.* I dont mean like ""haha watch me do this crazy thing without freaking out"" kind of self-control, rather I literally cannot even fathom what its like to not have control over ones own body and my mind instinctively fights losing control. There are two situations recently that have really turned this from curiosity to a nagging source of worry whether I should seek some sort of counseling or mental health help.   First, very recently my partner and I both got drunk. Like, drunker than weve ever been, just to see how it feels. Were big guys and making the kind of drinks we like is expensive, so it takes a lot of money and alcohol to actually get drunk. My partner was barely able to walk, hes rolling on the floor, laughing, crying over how delicious the corndog hes eating is, having a gay old time. Meanwhile, Im sitting there just thinking about how hard it is to walk like this and what we would do if something bad were to happen while were impaired like this. Yes, I could feel that the alcohol was slowing me down, but otherwise I literally felt completely normal other than the coordination issues. I was honestly a little jealous that I didnt seem to feel like a different person like my partner.  Second, we recently attended a party with some friends and strangers that ended in a rousing game of Truth or Truth -- nobody actually wanted to come up with any dares because we were really just trying to get to know one another. One of the questions that came up was ""What is your greatest fear?"". Several regular answers came up, either spiders, or snakes, heights, etc., while mine were tied with two very related answers: Dying to an uncontrollable situation, such as a plane crash, bus crash, etc., or getting stuck. Not like a claustrophobic stuck, but getting literally stuck in a situation where you have to wait for either death or someone to come rescue you.  A few days after the party, I sort of came to the creeping realization that all of this might be related and that maybe theres something not normal with how I feel. This was only exacerbated by reading articles about Ayahuasca and Psilocybin causing some people to break down these great walls and feel like different people after their experiences with it. This is obviously not an option as I live in America where these things are illegal.  I have this constant nagging feeling like I need to find a way to release control, to the point that I can actually feel it in my chest like a source of stress whenever its on my mind. Is this  ? Is this some form of OCD symptom? Is this literally just some form of jealousy or frustration that I just need to get over? Ive tried googling this feeling but it just comes up with advice on how to better control yourself, which is the exact opposite of what I *think* I want.",1554246425,1554246426,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8qbuo/is_this_feeling_anxiety/,False,False,0.0

257,thatsroughbud,1.0,Scared to attend college graduation,"This is going to sound extremely stupid, but Im graduating in the spring and I really, REALLY dont want to walk. My  college is pretty big, and my highschool was very small, so the graduating class size difference is huge, and knowing that so many people are going to be there makes me ill. I can hardly walk across a 20 person classroom without feeling anxious, and I just know its going to be hell.  I was attempting to order my cap and gown and the price was ridiculous, so I tried to call my dad and lowkey began to beg him to not make me attend.   He took it as he thought I wasnt going to graduate at all (which is incorrect, Im actually graduating a year early), or that I was failing a class, and then just told me I was doing it, then pulled the card about how he didnt graduate and how he wanted to see his kid do it. I told him he saw both my brother and will see my sister graduate (likely twice, for my sister since shes doing graduate school), but he wasnt satiated.   I told him it makes me extremely uncomfortable to have so much attention on me and admittedly at this point I started crying, but literally like, no sympathy; he told me I shouldve thought about this before I told our family I was graduating and everyone started making plans. He also said that it would only be 2,3 hours of me being uncomfortable and I should deal with that since my family is coming. He also pulled the amount of student debt loans he will be paying off for me, and it only stressed me out more.   I asked him why couldnt we just like, get food or something and just celebrate it lowkey and he told me because my family is coming to see me graduate, not eat food, and I would be disappointing them and essentially, even though I told him I was uncomfortable, that the massive amount of people being there and the attention was really stressing me out, and I was lowkey crying during this, I still have to walk regardless of my feelings.     I just dont know what to do, and Im wondering if other people have had the same  , even if its ridiculous...     tl;dr Begged my dad to not make me go to college commencement ceremony and was met with no sympathy.

It first started when I read about it after believing that I may have experienced an smell hallucination. I got really freaked out and on Sunday, I started thinking about my future (I am graduating this year) and I felt really stressed. I was worried that it would trigger the onset of Schizophrenia, as I was really stressed when I thought about it and felt a bit of a failure because I have not been able to find a job as of late (Got 2 interviews this . All of a sudden, I got an intrusive thought that said ""Youre a failure"" and I freaked out I thought that I was hearing voices in my head. I didnt hear it again, but the next day I was doing my home work, I remembered that I did not hear the thought again, but then suddenly I thought of the thought again, and then I become hyper aware and was just doing my work but being on guard for the thought again, when I heard again another time. Later though, I did not hear it again and today I have heard it but when only I thought about it. I am not hearing this intrusive thought out loud or like a real life human voice, its in my head. I was wondering if anyone else has not had intrusive thoughts that go like ""Youre a failure"", ""Youre stupid"" throughout the day.  I also read about tactile hallucinations, especially the crawling with bugs. Yesterday as I was lying in bed, my body started feeling itchy and it felt like the bugs sensation and I felt this throughout the day today and a little bit yesterday. I am worried I am experiencing tactile hallucinations, thought I am wondering if this is due to my dry skin as I do not lotion my body and I am wearing a lot of layers - as well I am being constantly aware of my body surroundings to make sure everything feels right. Its not too much of a crawling sensation, its like a tingling itch that sometimes feels like bugs.  I am seeing a therapist on Thursday to make sure that everything is right and how to tackle the   problem. But from what it sounds like, should I be worried or is this just my health  . I am not seeing things or hearing things that are not there.",1554245778,1554245779,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8q7p6/afraid_of_schizophrenia/,False,False,0.0

270,ImSoSoAnxious,1.0,Anxious about posting my art online,"17M. Ive wanted to be an artist for as long as I can remember. Just this week I decided I want to post my art online and monetize it. The problem is whenever I try to upload something I keep hesitating because I dont know how people will react to it. When I was 15 I got publicly blasted on a forum. To be fair what I said was kinda dumb and I probably deserved it to an extent. But still, that whole experience made me afraid of posting anything online. I actually dont mind when people criticize my art itself and I know that its necessary if I want to get better, Im just afraid it will get personal. I know that now that Im older I probably have enough sense not to repeat that mistake, but still I lack confidence when it comes to sharing my own work. Any advice on how I can get over this insecurity? Thanks.",1554241394,1554241395,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8pdpv/anxious_about_posting_my_art_online/,False,False,0.0

272,junkyardprince,1.0,"I got used to a messy life, the hardest part is being comfortable with the norm now.","19, f  Gonna start this out with context life story, idk if its okay to post that here tbh Skip to the last paragraph for my true anxieties  Grew up moving yearly with my emotionally abusive and manipulative mother. She was the only constant in my life other than the internet and my passion for art. I have a few half siblings, and lived with a few for moments of my life. At 13 I lost my younger middle sister and she was to her father in a won custody battle. Shes lived a beautiful life now with her Dad, and Im envious because he used to be the only father I thought I had yet Im invisible to him now.   Still moving yearly due to mum dragging me to follow her impossible dreams of living in cities in Cali, only to fail and rely on strangers as roommates in rural towns on multiple occasions. As I said, my story changed yearly Eventually she settles with one guy, but still shes so addicted to change at this point and keeps dragging me through the pattern of new schools, new places, new everything. She wants me to go through art school and live with her forever under her dictatorship.   Eventually I lose the concept of friendship, and I barely make friends from 16-18. I engulf myself in obsessive romantic relationships with the ultimate goals to get away. Escape. I take all of them very seriously emotionally, yet none last longer than 7 months. All I have for support are people who are a handful of friends hundreds of miles away online, and a (now ex) boyfriend who put me through an ultimatum at 17 to move out and do what I wanted, or I lost him.  He was fucked up too and warped a lot of my views on intimacy, and the true meaning of success and wants in life. He does things in a unhealthy way that work for him, but not for me, yet I did it.   I dont regret it, but I decided to tell my mum I was moving at as soon as I could when I turned 18. I was on lockdown for 3-4 months, no social interaction since it was the summer before my senior year. I only had a roku hooked up to a monitor to entertain myself, and a hidden shitty smartphone that I stole from my mums boyfriends weird retired smartphone farm. I planned to move in with my boyfriend at the time, and he bails on me and says I cant due to his own mental health issues. I felt betrayal and anger, but ultimately sadness.  Eventually I get a win in. I get to have my mum give temporary guardianship to my older sister, and I move in with her a month before my 18th birthday. I start school there, and all is good.  Once Im 18 I cut my mum out of my life after she tried to drag me home before hurricane irma hit FL. Following that I evacuated the state temporarily to another state, meeting with one of my only long term friends, and meeting her friends. I fall in love with one, and stay in contact after I go back to FL. Im still with my boyfriend of the time, but after a while break up with him. I get with this other boy, and maintain a long distance relationship. At home with my sister, Im getting sexually manipulated by roommates while she dosent know, and with feeling stuck there I decide to move out on my own. This all is within half a year. I move out in December, live with my best friend since freshman year of high school. I love her, tbh. Shes been the only GOOD constant in my life.  Im dating this new guy, and hes showing me a side of the world Ive never seen. Hippies, weed, music, a loving family that functions well despite flaws. By flaws, physical fights that would happen sometimes, but still were traumatic to experience. I trusted him and his lifestyle, and obsessed about how perfect and happy I was to be a part of it.  I decide to move in with him in April 2018, everything was good until then. Were living there for only a week and I come back from a day at school and he breaks up with me and kicks me out. I have a huge mental breakdown, Im lost, I can still feel how shattered my mind and heart felt throughout that fucked up day. He had trust issues, serious insecurities, and numerously told me to just figure myself out as he would do the same. He wanted me to fuck around with other guys, despite that not being the person I wanted to be. For months he continued to push me to do this, and I kept talking to him, making plans, we still loved each other but it turned into something toxic and unrealistic.  I move back in with my best friend whod moved since I did. I slept on a couch and lived in a closet, we were in a 2bdrm apt and barely had any room for me. I got sexually assaulted by another roommate here without my best friend knowing at the time, and eventually he was kicked out. We had 3 more long distance friends come to replace him. I ended up meeting someone in the mean time. Someone who has really been unlike any other person in my life, hes like a best friend and everything more. During all of this we hanged out every night, drank and smoked, I cried and vented, we would laugh a lot. We eventually got intimate, and I wasnt proud of it, but I was happy with it. Hes still been nothing but sweet to me.  My ex thought I was fucking around and guilted me for it. I still loved my ex, and lied to him about not doing anything with this other guy. This was repeated for months until my ex was around again. He wanted to be with me, and we were. I thought I was happy but something didnt feel right. He made me cut ties with my FWB, and that hurt like nothing ever had before. It felt like I was betraying myself, I was missing out on something.  I fell out of love within a week, it was fast and terrifying but I found every flaw and never saw what it was that I loved about him as a person shine through. This was the worse panic attack week of my life. I didnt eat, my heart was constantly beating incredibly fast, and my mind was nonstop racing in doubt. I didnt want to hurt this person anymore than he already had been, but I didnt want to suffer through something I was so unsure of. I broke up with him and cut him off. October of 2018. The same day I called my FWB, and he ran over to comfort me immediately, called off work for the day and everything. I missed him so much, and having him back meant everything. He was my best friend for the past few months, he was my escape from the drama of that relationship and the drama I had at home as well, and beyond that, we were good personal friends. He made me feel like I really mattered for the first time, matter to myself, and not just as an addition to his life. He didnt objectify me or try to own me as a trophy. He didnt try to get me to change myself to better suit him.  Ive had my moments of happiness, but a lingering sense of doubt and fear is rising again. Its different this time. Im now dating my past FWB, and for the most part I think what Im going through is.... settling into a norm. I dont have many friends other than who I live with. I didnt hang out with people growing up, and I dont understand maintaining a normal friendship. I think Im doing good, but Im numb sometimes to where I think I should be feeling happiness, love, and gratitude. Or simply bliss. I used to feel these a lot when my friendships and relationships here first started, but I think Im past the puppy love of that.  I dont want to leave my boyfriend. I dont want to move to a different city or state because I dont know anyone anywhere. My sister recently moved within a few hours from me and shes my only family in that aspect. I dont know where my life will go. I dont know what living normally is like, and I dont know what answers Im looking for. I just want to feel content and stop stressing over the unknown, but even my present life feels unknown to me.  Being somewhere good for once, its starting to reach that 7 month mark Ive never gotten past before, and I feel like I should be happier but something is holding me back. Something is, and Im scared, constantly, and dont know what to do.

274,elle0931,1.0,My anxious journey (so far),"Hello. New person here. :3 I just want to share how my   has begun and developed since I got it. There isnt really any real reason other than that. Im sorry if that is not allowed. :i  Im a 19 y/o girl from Denmark. Here, we have a different school system. After going through public school for 10 years, we can choose to go to a gymnasium for 3 years. After that, we can go to universities.  Im in my last year and will finish this summer. Though my   started to show halfway through the gymnasium, winter of 2018. I was kinda stressing about grades at that point but it wasnt really bad. I didnt notice anything before a philosophy class where I answered something wrong. My first thought was to just dig my nail into my forarm. And so I did. I didnt worry and just went on with my life. I had a few   symptoms in the following months but I didnt really care. It wasnt until I got a full-blown   attack that I though to myself ""Maybe something is wrong.."" In June, the exams started. Up until this point, I had a few more attacks but I kept it to myself. I only had two exams so it was okay. But just before my chemistry exam, I had yet another   attack. I overcame the   just as it was my turn. I ended out with a B+ so yay. At this point, I had a feeling that I might have gotten  . Im not fast. xD  While all this was happening, I somehow drunkenly flirted me to my current bf, who is trying his best to be helpful.  The summer break was   free. So I figured that my   was connected to school. My theory was proven right after the summer. School started and so did the  . It just picked up from where is left. It was beginning to tear at my self confidence at this point which didnt make things better. On top of that, I began to self-harm with my nails and scissors (Im hella scared of knifes). Faster down the rabbit hole I went. It was starting to affect my everyday life before I actually told my friends and bf about it. Seeing how sad my selfharm made them, made me stop pretty fast. They all agreed that I should talk to my doctor about  . My response was something like ""Its fine. Dont worry about it. It will pass."" Spoiler alert. It didnt pass.  In the start, my   was rooted in school and grades. But is slowly moved to the fear that my bf would leave me. This made my relationship with him a bit harder since some of the thing he does, would give me  . I also started to communicate less with him about my   because I hate to feel like a burden. Luckily, we are a good match and we normally find a way to talk about it.  Around this point, I also started to apologize a lot. Even for things that I had nothing to do with. I only apologize when I feel guilt, but I felt it often so said sorry a lot.   After a couple of weeks, my friends finally convinced me to talk to a doctor about it. I started talking to a psychologist in December, almost a year after the first symptoms. The first few sessions was pretty useful but I have now (April 2019) come to a point, where I dont feel like talking to The Man (thats what I can the psychologist) helps anything anymore. I have started to selfharm again with nails, pens and bitting. In the last 6 months, I have only had two   attacks though; both with my bf next to me to help and hold me.  So right now, Im living in the fear that I will fail all my classes and the love of my life with leave me. Neither of my parents know (I keep it from them for personal reasons) but the people who knows are super supportive and I really appreciate that. Unrelated but kinda related: Im going to the doctor tomorrow to get tested for adah.  If you got this far, Im sorry if it was super boring. I just felt like this was the right place to tell my story.

275,justthatweirdo,1.0,I'm so overwhelmed I feel like I can't get anywhere!,"Im in therapy, I take 100mg of Sertraline, I try to practice mindfulness and stuff but all of this only helps \*a little bit\*     Prepare yourselves, youre in for a ramble...     Work: I am in Accounts Payable (43k/yr - CAN) and took on HR duties a month into my promotion. I work in the same office as my supervisor (Controller), Arthur, and I hate him most days. He listens to the same grungy, 2000s emo rock playlist EVERYDAY on speakers...EVERY DAY. I have legitimately thought about taking a pair of scissors to his speaker cord when he leaves (because Im here earlier than him and later than him every day) and blame it on mice or something. When I started working 2 job duties it was a cake walk and I really enjoyed it. But then we hit year end, management wanted to hire many employees at once, and I was/am required to coach the receptionist (that was my job before this one) on the things management is nitpicking about. ALSO just last week I was getting reemed by the owner of our company for not getting applications quick enough so we can get some new staff (because I have control over how popular our job ads are and how many resumes are submitted as a result). I am also getting reemed by him because our current receptionist isnt meeting his standards, which should be ARTHURs job to coach one of his underlings BUT NO...IT""S ME...THE ONE EMPLOYEE WHO MAKES LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT OUR SUPERVISOR, ARTHUR, MAKES.   I have no time to catch up. My desk is a mess. The only way Ill possibly be able to catch up is to work OT, which I dont get paid for. Speaking of pay, I never received a salary compensation or any kind of compensation when I started working TWO jobs in one. Nothing. I was just expected to work HR alongside Accounts Payable at the same time and stay at the same salary. My annual performance review is in a week so I plan to ask for a fair salary increase but in the meantime Im about ready to scream.     Dogs: Ive posted on Reddit before, about my sick dog, and this is one of the biggest triggers in my life. My beautiful old man poodle, Sunny, has Congestive Heart Failure (2 years now) and Kidney Disease (since January). We decided to continue medication for his CHF and just treat the KD with special kibble. This is a HUGE financial strain. Just in May (yes next month) I will be paying minimum $350 for prescription refills (to last 3 months before I get to do that again). Additionally, one of his diuretics costs me $45/month. I was playing around with my projected budget today and realized that if any emergency were to happen with him that required any extensive vet care, or the vet recommends an increase in prescription dosage to make him comfortable, I would not be able to afford it. I would have to put him to sleep because I failed on budgeting properly - thus failing him.     Finances: So yes, Im butt-ash broke. I get paid a nice salary but I dont feel its appropriate to my work load, and my expenses far outweigh my salary. I pay for a sick dog, Trudeau instilled a carbon tax which will increase bills, my car payment is insanely high, I cant afford to buy new clothes that fit (so I wear the same outfits each week), FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS, right?     School: So Im over-worked, no time for me or to even breath, no spare funds AND im a student part time. I am taking 3 courses this semester; passing one (weirdly enough), failing another, and just passing by on the third. My finals are next week and Im behind. Work pays for my classes I just have to pay for textbooks (which I have to come up with the money for.......)     Me: With all this stress comes weight gain! As i mentioned, most of my clothes dont fit. I dont have much spare time to hit up a gym or think hard about a meal plan for the week because the small amount of spare time I do have is spent crying, distracting myself with Youtube or doggos, or sleeping. My newest symptoms (Ive never had a Hollywood   attack so I dont know what this classifies as) on my   include difficulty breathing. I can try to practice deep breathing techniques but I feel like Im suffocating and cant get that satisfying breath - thus leading to further stress/ . Also I have difficulty sleeping through the night. Every 3rd night or so Im up at 3:30 and maybe get an extra 15min-30min before I have to wake up for my alarm at 5:00 am.  My therapist is worried about me burning out and how Im able to handle all this but still have a relatively positive outlook.     Boyfriend: my lovely boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years at the end of April. We cant afford to do anything so thats cool. But more importantly, my emotions ( /stress/depression) are rubbing off on him and now HE""S feeling the same emotions. So on top of ALL my baggage, Im trying to make him feel less of these negative emotions because I feel like I""M the one making him feel this way. Im broke, so he tries to help which affects his finances. Im stressed so hes stressed. THERE""S NO WINNING.     Im at work right now trying to prioritize my extremely cluttered desk in this stuffy, windowless office while its snowing outside at 3 degrees Celsius, while trying to figure out how Im going to have time to get caught up in work, school and life. Please send help.     TLDR: Im overwhelmed and struggling to find a balance...  Sorry if my ramble doesnt make sense. Really, Im just trying to blow off some steam. If you read it, I applaud you!

I felt completely helpless the entire time; the doctors wouldn’t do any proper testing since they believed it was   (which they were right about), but their approach didn’t reassure me of anything and I continue to deal with strong physical   symptoms. By the beginning of therapy, I couldn’t even stand for 5 minutes and I was so weak from all of the stress of my circumstance. I went to the ER, got placed on antidepressants, and dropped out of that semester of university.   I’ve been on antidepressants for 7 weeks now and I think it’s beginning to take it affect. The first couple weeks were hard and essentially peaked my physical symptoms which made it uncomfortable being anywhere besides my room.

( I never experienced  …. As far as I know) I never freak out, lose my cool, worry. But, I do get extremely uncomfortable in awkward situation, conversation and while speaking publicly. The doc prescribed Fluoxetine 20mg, after taking the drug, my heart rate started racing, got scared and stopped. Few days later, started Escitalopram 5mg, now that gave me shortness/tightness of breathing, got scared shit less, stopped. Had heartbeat issues since then on and off, not a big deal, though the drug might still be in my system. 2 weeks later, doc stared me on a Lamotrigine 25mg, ended up in ER due to allergic reaction. Week later, I finally got better after ER gave me prednisone for allergic reactions etc.. my heart rate is OK, no chest tightness but, my throat is bothering me at night like crazy, feel tightness there, feel like my wind pipe is tight, dry, closing, etc.. I don’t feel the same during the day, not sure if its because I’m aware and don’t feel anything standing up, but while sleeping, my throat wakes me up 2 hours later, or even every couple hours.

I dragged myself out of bed, I breathed my way through panic attacks in crowded lectures, I powered myself on overpriced coffee cuz I was so tired from overthinking the night before just to suffer heart palpitations from the caffeine but never let it showed in case somebody thought I was weird, I spent everyday contributing and finding myself enjoying it then coming home and thinking of all the stupid mistakes I made bearing myself up about it, I stayed up late perfecting work that wouldn’t even be marked but if I didn’t do it I was scared something would  happen.   It is probably just a glitch or they have the wrong person. But you spend a lot of   dealing with things outside of rationality. Reality is that I’ve felt invisible and insignificant for a while and being told I wasn’t even at uni just confirms it. My boyfriend  even had a go at me for being upset about it cuz it’s silly and just a mistake but it has really upset me and will really play on my mind.   I go to every session and sometimes it’s just me who goes. I am in a constant battle with my mind but I put in the effort where other ppl haven’t and for absolutely nothing. A fear of failure cripples me like you wouldn’t believe and now I have this irrational feeling that I have failed when I haven’t.   I complained to the uni.

A couple months ago we were sort of sexting and Id sent her a vid I was watching of a specific porn star. She liked it, like I did, and she began watching all of that specific girls videos. Fine, whatever, shes a porn star. Then she started looking at all of the girls personal stuff, and following her on instagram, and etc. I started to feel uncomfortable (the betrayal had come out fairly recently during this time) but kept trying to put it out of my mind but when she showed me she was following this relatively unknown queer porn star I got upset. Later on I told her that it triggered me a little, that she moved what was this unobtainable porn star into a realm of reality by following her personal instagram. She reassured me and we moved on.  Then about a month ago we were laying together at her apartment and watching something on her computer and she screenshot something from what we were watching, and this pulled up a recent screenshot she took of that same porn star. Just a random selfie clearly from her personal page that she was saving for some reason.  I got really upset, again. She could tell and I said I didnt want to talk about in the moment. I thought I could reassure myself but I was upset that she was now just saving selfies of some other girl, who she also is like watching in porn and following on insta.  We talked about it a little later when I couldnt shake it off and I said that because of everything happening that wasnt making me feel good that shes saving pictures of some girl she watches fuck. Like its not just porn now, shes outright saving just normal selfies of some fucking girl.  She does this thing where she tries to excuse her behavior using irrelevant shit, so she was like well I save lots of things like sometimes when Im drawing something and need a reference. And I was like ok, is that what youre doing? And she said no Im just saying. And I was like thats irrelevant then.  The whole thing was stupid. Its not something Id typically give a shit about. Like go ahead and find someone attractive, I do the same thing. But because of what happened Im on near constant edge, a lot of which is also Im just an anxious person.  So what do I do.

Lately I’ve been having a lot of   about what happens after death, what my purpose in life is, if I am truly “happy,” etc. The increase in   has made me feel sad time to time because I used to be able to relax and not overthink literally everything. Then I get anxious that I might be depressed even though I don’t have any of the classic depression symptoms, i.e. I still enjoy things and I definitely want to be alive.

I have made countless trips to the doctor because minor symptoms I believe are cancer, usually stage 4 and fatal. I obsess over symptoms and conceived illnesses until months have gone by and i finally get the courage to go to the doctor.   Last night i noticed a horizontal dent/groove above my thigh muscle. It’s not congruent with my other leg so i started to panic. Let me preface this with the fact my lower thigh was a little achy so i started compulsively feeling for lumps as i usually do and that’s when i discovered the “dent”. After googling i found three things-ALS, MS and a dozen other people who are perfectly healthy who have the same thing and attributed it to constant pressure. Sure enough the dent lines up perfectly with my bathroom counter and  every morning and evening i lean against it to put on contacts, floss, and do my make up and have for years. This is a simple explanation but now that I’ve researched ALS and MS I’m beginning to have tingling sensations, pain, and so forth and now I am in a vicious cycle of worry and compulsive research and symptom checking.   My husband who is the sweetest human alive told me he is no longer going to acknowledge my symptoms or new illness’ because he feels he’s just adding fuel to the fire and i don’t blame him. Deep down i know for being a 30 year old relatively healthy woman I am most likely always fine but it doesn’t stop me from Obsessively worrying and checking and researching.

326,jackmagger,1.0,"I am so confused about my anxiety. I can't seem to pinpoint the causes of the feelings I have. The pressure in my chest, the severe nausea, and the overall lack of quality living. What do I do? I would love to start working toward fixing this. thanks in advance, everyone!","First of all, for anyone who actually reads through all of this, THANK YOU.  To give some back story Ill start by saying that   is something that runs in my family so of course Im starting to realize that it very much is running through me. This whole thing started out as what my doctor thought was **functional dyspepsia** (really gnarly acid reflux) Ive experienced what I believe is social   for as long as I can remember whenever Im placed in a situation where I have to perform in front of people or interact. Back in primary school class presentations were my nightmare. By the time I went through college it had only gotten worse. But then by my senior year of college it all seemed to go away. I was able to speak in groups confidently, shares thoughts in a group setting without feeling any kind of strain on my mind or body. So now fast forward about three years and here we are. After working in retail for those three years Id like to think that retail was the cause of my  s resurgence due to the insane amount of pressure that environment puts on you physically and mentally. So far my worst symptom by FAR is the nausea and subsequent clamminess I experience. This started when I would get up in the morning and Id have a cup of coffee and then start my day. Shortly after having my coffee though I would start to feel sick. Initially I thought nothing of it but soon I realized that I had a serious problem. It quickly progressed to feeling nauseous on my short drive to work and then into the first hour or so of my shifts. If I managed to put up with it long enough to stay at work I would but most of the time it would get so bad that I felt like I had no control over it and would have to leave shortly after it started. So after going to the doctor a handful of times thinking this was all some kind of stomach problem related to my inherent acid reflux (and trying a slimmed down diet with extra caution toward just about anything that could make my stomach upset) I realized that this might not be the right angle to approach this at. After doing a good chunk of reading Im starting to wonder if this is all caused by an underlying  /stress problem that Im not aware of. Im completely stuck right now. I feel like Ive lost all confidence due to this constant worry that Im going to start feeling nauseous. I would LOVE to hear what peoples experiences are with this type of symptom, how you went about getting diagnosed and whatnot, and how I can start to work toward reducing the   or stress that Im experiencing. A side note to add too is that I am by no means living what anyone would consider a stressful life. In fact I find that Im in a very comfortable position and feel that I have every avenue available to succeed as long as I can ditch this feeling Im having.

She drew the ""social   spiral"" on a whiteboard, using my worst ever incident of SA as a basis, and my god...it was like seeing the genetic code of it all laid out before my eyes.

350,JulietKilo_,1.0,Feeking guilty for making the right decision,"I apologize for any formatting issues. Im on mobile. TLDR at bottom.  I graduated college in December and started working at my first professional job in December. Overall, the job is a ~fantastic~ resume builder. I work at one of the better known companys in my  industry. For context, my mother lives 14 hours away from me, in another state, and people there have heard of my company in a positive manner.  Here are a few issues I have:  1. I made it very clear in my interview that I wanted to be trained in a specific area of the company. They were very receptive of this, and were seemingly very excited. One of the interviewers wrote this down and underlined it multiple times. This area is very important for my future career goals, which is why I was so upfront about this   So when I start my training, I notice this area is not included on my training schedule. I bring it up to my manager about three weeks in, and I was told Id be put ""on the list."" I dropped it, and was satisfied at that point. I wait another 2 months before bringing it up, and was told this time that it would ""be a while.""  Two other people must be trained there first as they were there longer than I (which is 100% fair. Im not mad at that). Basically, Im looking at a minimum of six months before would even be considered to train in this area. Thats just a guess, as well. I have no real timeline. I find this discouraging, and it makes me less happy at my current position.   What makes thus worse is that I turned down a part time position, specifically in this area Id like, to accept this full time position. From my interview, I was under the impression that their excitement meant I would be trained there. I blame myself for being 22 and naive, as this was my first professional job.   That brings me to point #2. I am working third shift. This is something I was not very thrilled about, and knew that I did not want before I started applying to jobs. I applied for only first and second shift positions, fully expecting to be offered second (first is kind of a right of passage in my field). I knew that third shift was equally as likely, but knew I did NOT want thirds. When I was interviewing, they asked if I was receptive to third. I told them I strongly preferred second, but would am keeping an open mind. The only reason I accepted this third shift position is because of how highly seen this company is in my field.   I am very unhappy working thirds. I dont feel like my days off are truly days off. I sleep through half the day, and no longer am able to partake in family traditions without feeling exhausted (lunch with my grandma every Sunday), or normal outings. My SO of 4 years is on dayshift, as are the rest of the regular people in my life. Although I can still make dinner plans, I feel isolated. I dont enjoy my hobbies. I have not touched my computer since I started this schedule, and my computer was a big  point of entertainment for me. I feel that if I spend time on it, Im isolating myself even further.  Clearly its affecting my mental health in a negative manner.   This was something I was more okay with when I was under the impression that I would be trained in that area. Although I am extremely grateful for the experience Ive been given, I feel as if I wont make any progress in my career if I stay at this company.  Ive started applying elsewhere, and have an interview later this week. I feel extremely guilty for wanted to leave my current position after 3 months (by the time I actually leave, it will be 4.5 months, I want to give solid notice). I am usually one to stick with a job for at least a year. I know that this is the best choice for my career in terms of experience (not so much comp any reputation), and an even better choice for my mental health. I know I SHOULDNT feel guilty for doing whats right for myself, but I do.  Sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent   TLDR: My first professional job has officially told me I will not be training in an area that is vital for my career goals, after the initial impression that I would be trained there. Its three months into the position, and I feel as if I wont make any progress going further. I am also working graveyard shift which has severely impacted my emotional health. I am looking for new employment, but feel guilty for doing so already. Ive been driving myself crazy this with, as I usually dont leave a job until at least a year or a better opportunity is given to me. In this case Im seeking another opportunity, so its an active process by me. I know I SHOULDNT feel guilty, as this is overall better for me. My guiltiness is just my   manifesting because Im nervous about leaving and talking with my current boss about it, once I do find new employment",1554212368,1554212370,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8jcnb/feeking_guilty_for_making_the_right_decision/,False,False,0.0

Last weekend it was my birthday and I was catching the train to Liverpool, I have been to Liverpool on the train loads of times in the past few years. I felt fine mentally, but I was not fine physically. I got a bad stomach and felt sick and was shaking. Its common for me to be like this when flying or going somewhere new, but then I am usually mentally panicking as well. Have you ever experienced this? Its so strange, my head is clear and I dont feel any   but my body does. Ive had a similar   on a train once, it was like a wave of just dread and horribleness came over me.

358,JackelSR,1.0,Recent Persistent Anxiety that Doesn't Go Away.,"So about a month ago I transferred to a new division. Ive been working for the same company in mostly the same sort of job position for a decade and a half. The first week in the new position I had to take most the week off the attend a funeral for my great aunt, her sister passed about 6 months prior. The week after that I found myself hospitalized after only working two days.  While in the hospital I learned that A) Ive been misdiagnosed twice for conditions I didnt have. B) I had a condition called an Ileus, to which no one could figure out what caused it. At the end of a week in the hospital and a couple days rest at home I was able to return to work.  Its normal to be anxious about a new job, and in effect I started the same new job pretty much three times in a row due to family and health. But, the   stayed and continued getting worse to the point I started to feel dread going to work. I started trying to pinpoint why, thinking it was something with my coworkers, something in the environment, I wasnt sure. I honed in on thinking one of my coworkers was the issue.  Ultimately talked to HR about it, and finally my coworkers, only to start to realize that the problem was something with myself. At this point I already feel like I fucked things up. I sought medical attention, got prescribed anti-  medication (Buspirone). I took off a few days from work to allow the meds time to do their thing. The first few days I seemed ok. Id wake up at night with my heart pounding but wasnt sure why and didnt feel anxious, just a little annoyed that I was awake.  Again, for the first few days these seemed to work pretty well. When negative thoughts entered my mind, theyd just sort of get forgotten about. Unfortunately, the day before returning to work, all of the   came rushing back worse than before, despite the medication. My wife was talking to me about what my plan was and I found that I wasnt able to answer and eventually just broke down. The frustrating part is that I generally hold it together really well even in pretty intense situations. On rare occasions something will set me off, but its usually me getting pissed off for a moment, then Im ok and back to normal.

367,stardreamos,1.0,Regarding finding a stable job.,"This is a problem ive been having for years now. I have a hard time applying for jobs not only because they never really get back to me, but because i feel ive somehow managed to convince myself that ""ill just screw everything up"" even at retail jobs. I try my hardest to get things done, but usually i take longer than theyd prefer me taking or dont have proper accommodations to keep my stress levels low.     For instance, When I was working as I was a cashier. I was actually pretty confident with the position until.... they started expecting me to do the membership card things, something that i personally knew that i couldnt make myself comfortable doing. not only that, but they expected me to not only scan items but bag them as well, and that made me what I felt was ""too slow"".     Id request help on busier days but nobody really cared. Eventually got to the point i started to have stress-fueled   attacks and had to often step away. At a point they had me in a back room where I could work on organizing gift cards and managing inventory while i was actually allowed to listen to music, which helped me stay completely focused! it was a really nice position for me and there were a few that liked me there! I was glad.     But then a few of the supervisors got all weird about it and made me go back to positions that they kept expecting nearly too much of me for. I made it through the seasonal period but im scared to really try applying for them again after that, also considering the fact i cant convince myself theyll even look at the application in the first place like most of the other places i tried to apply for. I really need something stable too... but most of the things i feel i can actually function in environment wise are always not hiring (game based jobs, jobs that keep me occupied without needing me to talk to people, so on. im willing to get out of my comfort zone but if I cant handle it there will be problems that may make the job too stressful on me)     Doesnt help I need money for my medication which is getting pricier and i lose my health benefits from my mom next year... so any advice or suggestions on what i should do to have more success either convincing myself to look for a job i can handle would be really immensely appreciated.      Im glad I found this reddit, because i really was starting to lose hope in all this due to   just taking over and being super exhausting to fight against.

Where do you guys land on the scale?,"   **10/10 - Around one minute to fall asleep:** Head hits the pillow and its lights out, barely time for a single thought.     **9/10 - Around 3-4 minutes to fall asleep:** You find a comfy position, briefly think about everything you need to do the next day and you just drift off.     **8/10 - Around 5-10 minutes to fall asleep:** Your mind wanders a bit, but sleep overcomes you fairly quickly.     **7/10 -  Around 10 - 15 minutes to fall asleep:** It’s a little bit annoying, you wonder why you haven’t fallen asleep yet, but you doze off before you can think too deeply about it.     **6/10 - Around 15 - 25 minutes to fall asleep:** You toss and turn for a bit, you have a little bit of a hard time dozing off, but you get there eventually.     **5/10 - Around 25 - 45 minutes to fall asleep:** Ok now it’s starting to grate you, You feel restless, you’re having a hard time finding a comfortable position, your mind won’t shut off. Eventually, instinct takes over and you fall asleep.     **4/10 - Around 45 - 60 minutes to fall asleep:** You’ve spent the equivalent of an entire episode of Game Of Thrones just tossing and turning, unable to find the off switch for your brain. This insomnia thing is really starting to waste your time.      **3/10 - Around 60 - 90 minutes to fall asleep:** Sleep has completely stood you up. The process to sleep is long and tiresome. You desperately try to grasp at a sense of relaxation, but it seems to do nothing. You’re just laying around with your eyes closed. Somehow, after much deliberation, you finally doze off.     **2/10 - Around 1.5 - 3 hours to fall asleep:** Tossing, turning, getting up to for water, getting up again to go to the bathroom. This really sucks. You’re starting to stress out, you know that you’re edging closer and closer to your alarm. Eventually, you get tired enough to pass out.     **1/10 - 3 - 5 hours to fall asleep:** You’re desperate and angry. You wonder why God hates you. The anger just makes you more awake. It’s ok to cry at this point. After what amounts to almost a whole school day you finally drift longingly into a fitful sleep.     **0/10 - No sleep.** ",1554196665,1554196666,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8gui1/im_curious_about_the_links_between_anxiety_and/,False,False,0.0

379,Cactuar_Tamer,1.0,I never know what I'm supposed to do.,"I dont know why but one of my triggers has always been changes in ""my"" environment. Even as child Id have crying meltdowns when my parents re-arranged the furniture in my room, which they nonetheless insisted on doing periodically. When I was older, I got the same about my desk in the classroom. Had to be a certain way and once it was god help anyone who interfered with that whether another student or an unwary substitute teacher because there was going to be a drag-out fight about it.     I cant *tell* you how it makes me feel when someone fucking *changes* something about my personal space without telling me or asking me, but a lot of you can maybe imagine. Even when I had to choose myself between a job transfer between one of two towns a a few years after college I was mired in   for a week after choosing. I think it would have been the same even if Id made the opposite choice. And despite the fact that Ive gotten better about it over the years to a point that Im personally proud of, even moved several times on my own, dealt with previous office-rearrangements with very minimal trouble, it stills goddamn *matters* to me, I cant help it.      So, yesterday, my team got told to move desks again. I looked at the new seating chart, and I was okay with it, I was *okay.*  I was going to handle it like I handled the previous ones. I was fine, basically, until I got to work today and saw that my team had just moved desks without me (we have flex time and I usually arrive at the start of core time) and had taken *my* space in the new desk area without apparently feeling the need to even consult me about it. When confronted they basically shrugged and said that it wasnt set in stone and we could decide among ourselves. Except they didnt! They decided among *themselves* and to hell with me. I didnt get a decision about what my space would be, and they didnt seem to care at all that they had done that.      My   was already spiking at this point so I took one of my in-case-of-emergency pills and left to cool my head and talk to a friend on the phone. When I came back the person on my team who Im most friendly with voluntarily offered to switch with me so I could be in my space.     I tried to talk to everyone afterwards, which was hard to do without my voice revealing how shaken up I felt, and they were  baffled and basically just laughed in my face and said it was nothing to be upset about. I said it might not matter to them but it mattered to me and they would have known that if they had thought to ask before disregarding my opinions entirely. And they still looked incredulous and like it was funny and then the three of them I have the worst relationship with left to the break area to stand around the water dispenser and probably talk about how ridiculous I am.      I dont know what to do or how to convey how what they did affected me.  I clearly didnt succeed in communicating any of that. I probably just made things worse. How am I supposed to talk to people. How am I supposed to make people understand. All I asked was to be consulted next time about where my space would be but they laughed at me. I dont know what Im supposed to do.

382,itsjustmejen,1.0,What do you do when it feels like everyone hates you?,"Im sorry this is a very long story, but this has been really killing me and i dont have anyone to talk to.  I went to my step brothers wedding this past weekend. He married a girl I grew up with in school. So for some background context, she used to be my bully in kindergarten, though shes grown now of course and gotten much better. I also knew her friends from school, who I had trouble getting along with as well. They would tease me for the smallest things and it would get me so uncomfortable I would run away from all of them. Now all of her friends, whom I hadnt seen in six years, were bridesmaids at the wedding. They wouldnt even look at me or talk to me but they loved hanging out with my little sister whos 19. This was the first occurrence that made me feel like crap.  At the reception, I was told that only immediate family was to line up for pictures, so I got in line for the food. Apparently, they went ahead and took pictures with EVERYONE except me. This really hurt my feelings and I just wanted to leave. It proved to me that me coming didnt even really matter to anyone.  I asked my grandmother if she would drive me back to my car when she left and she agreed. But she gave two strangers a ride instead so I felt like I was left all by myself. This put me in kind of panic mode and only exaggerated what I had been feeling all night. My dad got angry at me when I told him I was leaving.  Later on Facebook, I noticed the bride had tagged everyone that was at the wedding except, you guessed it, me.  So now everyone hates me because I had a panic attack. I felt like I was surrounded by people who didnt give a damn about me except for a few select people. The bride wouldnt even acknowledge me when I tried to talk to her, she literally pretended like she didnt see me when I came up to her.  How can I make this better? No one seemed to understand that if I feel like Im not wanted somewhere, then Im leaving. It just puts me in a panic and I start to cry and make an even bigger mess. It was one of those situations where it was supposed to be a really fun time but it just went from bad to worse. I hate feeling like a bad guy because I know Im not. And I do regret missing out on the rest of the celebration but I wouldve just been crying in a corner by myself and wouldve created bigger drama anyway.

385,PlayerTP,1.0,How changing my diet completely cured me. I'm not joking.,"I dont want to get anybodys hopes up with this. A disclaimer right away: my   came about completely out of nowhere about 3 years ago. I never struggled with it period from childhood all the way into full adulthood. Nobody in my family has any type of   disorder or depression (or any type of mental illness that I know of.) It hit me like a ton of bricks, I mean I went from completely happy and carefree to full-blown panic disorder in about a two-week span.   A few months ago, a coworker saw me drinking a diet coke and mentioned something about aspartame giving people headaches or something. That was interesting to me, so I did a bit of research on it. I saw in there somewhere a possible link between aspartame and serotonin levels in the brain. I didnt believe it and went about my life as normal.   One night exactly two months ago (yes, I kept track) I was having the worst night of my life. Panicking for about 6 hours straight. I was set on calling into work and checking into a hospital when the sun finally came up. I thought a ton that night, obviously. What is making me this way? Genetics? Brain tumor? Am I being punished for something?   Then I thought about the aspartame thing. It hit me: I drank a shit load of diet soda that evening. I had a diet coke with my McDonalds and I just discovered Fresca (lol) that day and fell in love, I drank 3 cans of that in about 2 hours. Thats on top of the normal amount I consumed daily, which was a whole lot.   I set out the next day to test this theory out. The next day, I drank only water and some coffee because I am addicted to caffeine. I didnt feel much better, but I felt a little better. I also cut down on nicotine a lot (I have heard forever about that contributing to  ). Every day I felt a little better, not a lot, but a little. Slowly I came back to how I was before. And now Im really better.   Im writing this post now at 2 AM because I cant sleep. Its not the kind of sleepless nights I used to have, where my heart is beating out of my chest and my mind is running wild. I cant sleep because Im so happy right now. Im really better.

392,throwaway024544,1.0,"Anxious about return to work from injuries, traumatizing deep seeded depression and issues, what to do?","I do apologize for the wall of text... I ended up explaining some of the relevant back story and trauma in my life. You can probably just read the question area but If you have time I think I do explain myself well.  About 7 months ago I was in a car accident where I crashed into a car at 60-70km/h, the person darted out into traffic and I couldnt stop the accident any more without crashing into other people. Both cars towed away. There were witnesses the other person was at fault if that matters.  Doctor gave me a month off work, no super serious injuries, my neck and back were in bad shape, I think the physio said grade 2 soft tissue and problems with the sacroiliac joint. I went back to work on modified hours and duties and gradually got back to full time, maybe 1 month modified hours. Part of the reason it went this way is because of doctors advice and lawyers advice, it was a fairly serious crash and I may as well take care of myself not like anyone else will. If Im being perfectly honest I probably could have probably gone back to work in 2-3 weeks, I dont know how much that matters, I mean the doctor told me to take that time off so I did. I think some people at the big job site Im at are probably miserable and wanted the time off themselves or something, some people asked me weird questions and I didnt know how to answer some of them. I also didnt know how to explain that my back isnt that bad but I took that time off. I think I felt guilty I dont know or they made me feel that way because Im very content with my decisions, Im doing everything smart to take care of myself I just care too much what other people think of me I think. Or more so I just didnt know how to carry myself when answering questions so they made me uncomfortable. Ive never been in that situation but it certainly gave me tons of   and I wish I was better at not giving a fuck and not trying to explain myself so much, I probably sounded dumb a little bit trying to explain the injury when I just shouldnt have answered to people who dont even give a shit about me what so ever. Some people probably just wondered what settlement Im getting, some people maybe thought I should have been back at work sooner I dont know. I hated that part to all that.  It turned out fine after some months really, I guess no one was weird in the end. I got used to work again everything was good....until recently things got really bad for me.  I should add in Im a pretty in shape guy, people know I play sports and go to the gym.  About a month and a half ago I just had enough of...everything. Ive been depressed, miserable and alone for so many years, over 10. Ive hid it for so many years but Ive just had enough. At my age of 29 I cant keep doing this, Im going to waste my life away just getting by but not living or being my actual self. I numb my deep pain by smoking weed which was good for a time, it probably lessened my suffering. I started when I was 16 but it took a bit of time to isolate and alienate, highschool ending helped with that. But weed also aloud me to push through the times somewhat, eased the pain. I definitely medicated with it. Its also mildly disconnected me from life ( I do have hope thats only temporary but a severe problem to recover from none the less ) and well its numbed my pain its also numbed my ability to be joyous and really be myself I guess. I have my reasons, Im not a fan of my dad, I know I was involved in child on child sexual abuse when I was maybe 5-6, Ive tried to talk to a therapist about it once, I know its probably caused different issues, trust issues,   and maybe more. That being said I really can have some great conversations with people, even though I may have   issues, trust issues, depression issues from being alone and not liking myself, Ive always had a natural strength in empathy and can really connect and have nice talks with people. I probably owe that to my awesome loving mother and my ability to read people and be thoughtful. Ive learned a lot over the years even if I havent fully put myself out there. As bad as its been, Ive lived a bit some of the time. Ive got a red seal in my trade, I had a girlfriend for a few years, I do have some high school friends that I see a couple times a year, maybe. I know a couple other people, but dont talk to them much. I dont use facebook, I havent in 10 years. I dont think Ive actually liked myself over the years, carried shame for sure.  I got to say as well a lot of good has happened in the last year or two despite all the bad. Getting my red seal and becoming a journeyman, going to the gym a lot and actually getting stronger. Learning tons about nutrition and exercise, feeling the benefits from a healthy diet. This helped with the helpless depression. Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time, as in I may be able to have some control in my life and be happy sometime in the near future. Now I am actually a lot smarter, I have money in the bank which Im just saying that cause I feel if I wanted to just not work for 6 months and truly focus on me I could do that and not worry about being finances at all. Money seems pretty important for a guy my age, I still live at home with my mom so too long may not be good, although when I consider my mental health any amount of money is worth not suffering more and letting these deep seeded issues just continue, I feel if im not careful they could continue until im 40.  So I said I had enough of everything, well what I did was told my work I got injured skiiing. People know I ski, I knew my headspace took a dive and I couldnt fake things anymore, I couldnt hide my depression at work and if I had to go in that day or week I think something bad would have happened. My brain said no more in a strong way. I didnt want to call in and say Im depressed because no one actually gives a fuck and that would stick with me worse, people would use it against me or something. I lied about the skiiing injury but it seemed like the best move. I cant stand the feeling of fabricating that shit its not right. But I know what is worse and its the feeling of severe depression and the feeling of it never changing which I know no one cares about. Only I can truly fix these things.  My jobsite has about 70 other people on the crew, I work with maybe 10-20 different people but see everyone all the time, Im not really close with anyone but they know who I am Ive been there 2+ years and up until this car accident I would always show up on time and work hard.  My doctor wants me off until mid April for this skiiing injury.  Heres what Im wondering and unsure of:  - Should I even return to work?  People know Im not there now due to another injury. I partly dont want to go back because Im afraid of what people will think of me, I care too much what they think and I think they all know Im not injured ( they really have no way of knowing )  - Time off is so much better to really make changes in my life and work on myself  Im less anxious with having to juggle work and everything else, I dont want to return with a negative attitude. My story does stand and Im pretty sure no one even gives a shit that Im not even there. Im experimenting with not smoking weed but I know I need to find other things that work for me as far as   goes, depression goes and being comfortable with who I am. I have a mild level of ADD to contend with as well but not the worst. I naturally developped some strategies for it and learned some others over time.  - How bad of a person am I for lying  There are other people working right now...I should be there, maybe. Although probably not if I actually want to take care of myself and be a person that people want to be around. Shutting down at work is bad and I just couldnt be there. Long term healthiness is what I want.

Than he had explained, i was at work indeed, but my mind wasnt quite there. He was right, yea, but... obviously at the time i have lots of stuff to think about. So than he goes on, that he isnt interested in excuses and that i am there to work and stuff, while rising his voice a bit.  So at that point, i was really, really close to lose it. I mean, lose it as in... start crying. I felt how my eyes started getting slightly more wet, hands shaking more and more, muscles in my legs weakened.  As he continued to explain me that i have to let my problems at home and concentrate more at my work and so on, i noticed that he suddenly stopped for a second and than that his attitude in his voice lowered, and that he explained it more basic and more thoughtful. I couldnt really think anymore but i managed to understand that he saw my hands shaking. wasnt a little tremble anymore. So he seems to had understood that i am clearly trying hard to not just black out.  And the rest of the day i had a chance to calm down.

Thats why Im late on the deadline already... on top of that, I have court coming up about my marijuana arrest. I got arrested in a bum-fuck county that still heavily punishes for marijuana charges, so Ill probably be on probation for a while, which scares the fuck out of me because someones going to be keeping in contact with me and that means having to go to appointments or get arrested.

Ive spent a lot of time with my family, helping take care of my grandma, and playing computer games. I have had some very dark periods during this time, but have slowly been taking steps to move forward over the past year (including going to a therapist).   I actually have aspirations to become a marriage and family therapist some day, and even applied to graduate schools this year, but I just havent had a job of any kind. After job searching here and there for over a year, and changing my expectations, I finally just got hired full time at a major department store as a sales associate in a brand new department. The department is a new sort of retail strategy, and the company is really excited about it. Even though I have  , I can come off as very sociable and mature (I do like people, I just dont trust myself to interact with them all the time), and this position is supposed to me more about engaging with customers than a typical sales associate.   While part of me is excited about this new job, and flattered that my manager liked me so much that I got hired even without retail experience, I am terrified that I am not going to be able to perform at the level they would like me to. I feel like I tricked them into hiring me by playing up my social skills and desire to please people. I fear that I will get totally overwhelmed and become noticeably affected by  , or that sometimes I just wont be able to muster the energy to act especially outgoing with customers. Today I did basic training, learning how to use the cash register, and just *that* felt sort of overwhelming, especially while imagining having to chat with a customer at the same time.  I know I am overreacting, and that this is *just a retail job* where Im barely being paid more than minimum wage. I am aware that usually when I go to a store, even the store I got hired at, the employees are not usually energetic bubbly social butterflies, instead theyre usually nice and basically helpful, but seem tired. I know that I am not going to be expected to master the register and retail sales overnight, I guess I am just really afraid of letting people down or being ""discovered"" as an imposter.   The good thing is that I finally got a job somewhere, and that it is *just retail*, so its not the end of the world if I dont like it or put 100% into it all the time, because its not my dream job. I really need the money, and this will get me some money. Most importantly I will get experience working with people and will force myself out of my hermit shell and into the world.

This is going to be kinda long, but I appreciate any time you take reading it or the TLDR.   Background: I’m a very successful engineer for my age (25M). I live alone, am on track to buy a house within about 2 years, have my dream car that I’ve wanted since I was 12, am in the best shape of my life, and really don’t have many responsibilities outside of work.   I grew up in an unstable household where my parents fought multiple times a week and I was constantly worried if I caused the fight, if they were going to leave me, if I was making their marriage worse, etc. They would try to get me on their side during each fight as I’m the only child, and then when they made up, they both would gang up on me with finding shit I had done wrong. They both were also perfectionists and I would get yelled at if I had anything less than straight As or if I didn’t mow the grass perfectly (not a single blade left on the concrete type shit). I’m sure it’s contributed to a host of issues for me, one being major trust issues. My relationship with my mom is miles better, my dad and I are on semi speaking terms depending on the week.   Despite all my successes, I can’t relax. If I’m kicking back (like right now) I feel guilty and my mind floods with a bunch of “wtf are you doing just lounging around” type comments. It gets really bad, to the point that I almost killed myself Senior year of college due to stress, and I’ve debated it since I was a kid, rather the thought that “I could run away and no one would give a fuck” when I was a kid because killing myself seemed unfathomable. I have no intention of killing myself, so no need to worry about that, but it definitely pops in my head a lot and I think about it, I just know I have the control to never do it.   I also have an unreasonable but very intrusive worry that I’m going to lose everything. Whether it be a health issue, my work deciding to fire me, or anything really, I’m constantly worried about if I did anything wrong and am going to lose everything soon. Keep in mind, I have enough money saved up that I could quit and survive for another 2ish years with no change to my lifestyle. I’m pointing this out to show how unreasonable my worries are, not to brag.   I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m completely disconnected from reality and am just going through the motions. I don’t actively feel involved in conversations, I hardly eat anymore (I’m 6’7” and I eat maybe around 1500 calories a day because I have no appetite), and anything that happens I feel like is just “how it is” whether good or bad. I honestly can’t remember the last time I laughed genuinely (but I always make others laugh), and I physically can’t get myself to cry (it’s probably been about 5 years since I’ve cried.   I’m mainly looking to see if anyone knows how to get my spark for life back. I can’t see myself doing this for the next 50+ years of my life.   TLDR: I feel like a bystander in my life and have no self motivation or feelings it seems. I’m very successful but that doesn’t resonate with my mind at all.

428,Elovera,1.0,Anxiety taking over everything / Sleeping problems,"I moved back to my home country in last December, after living abroad for around two years. I decided to move due to my mental health getting bad and I figured moving would be the best choice, since Ill have access to help in my native language. I got myself an apartment after massive struggles and things started to seem less devastating.     Ever since I moved back tho, my   has gotten so bad, I have hard time going to the store to buy groceries. I have the worst insomnia Ive ever experienced and Ive isolated myself in my apartment completely. The mental health care in my country is not too good, and Ive started to lose hope on that.  I never finished school, so now Im basically stuck at home making shit music to distract myself from my problems.     My main problem now is sleep. I have a panic attack almost everytime Im about to go to sleep. I live by distracting myself with stuff so I dont need to think about life, but when going to sleep, you cant really have yourself distracted.  This has resulted in me not sleeping for days, until i crash and the cycle repeats..     While i was living in the other country I dealt with life by being high 24/7. Here weed is really expensive tho, so I had to stop smoking due to being broke.     Im curious if my elevated   levels that Ive been experiencing, could be due to me quitting weed?  Ive been thinking about saving enough money to buy some, just so I could fall asleep better, but I dont want it to become a habit once again. Ive tried other sleep medication, but nothing besides weed has really worked so far.     regardless,  Does anyone have any tips for sleeping better? or has anyone experienced similar kind of   when going to bed?

It made everything grey and robotic.   Its not constant and some days I feel fine and dont worry so much, but other days, like today hence why I am reaching out to this forum hoping that people here will understand, it feels like I am being crushed from the inside.   My whole body is tense for hours and my mind wont stop racing. I consider myself to be average in most ways and I am no stranger to humility or humiliation but I would say I am a deeper thinker than most people I know. Not smarter, but more in depth in the way I think. I obsess to be honest, its not something I enjoy and often wish I could just rip that part of my mind out and be ignorant to the woes of the human condition.   I have had a lot of loss and damage in my past, mainly losing my mother young followed by my father rekindling an old flame to be led down a path of drug addiction and bad choices. I know many people suffer far greater sorrows and I in no way feel like I am special or deserving of any kind of special treatment in the scope of every persons individual experience, but these are mine and thus is my world view.   My main problem is the combination of obsessive thought processes accompanied by the   driven physical and mental stressors that make me feel like I am just on the precipice of the next disaster in my life. Almost all the time.   This makes the things in life I dislike make me feel more intensely that doom is waiting, and the things I love to be clouded by the negative thoughts and feelings.   Its at times unbearable.   Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did, just writing this and putting it out there makes me feel a tiny bit better, just getting it out of my head.

450,ComputationallyLost,1.0,I'm worried that my anxiety has ruined any chance of succeeding in grad school,"Hi all. Throwaway account. I would really appreciate some advice. Currently in third semester of grad school, specializing in Computational Chemistry. When I applied for my research group, the advisor had expressed to me that he was planning to retire soon, but was willing to give me a shot. So far my experience has been relatively good, and my advisor has been helpful with any research related help Ive needed. The last few weeks however, Ive been questioning whether I really belong in the program. Back in October I got out of an extremely toxic friend relationship that I didnt realize was abusive until I started going to my therapist. Ever since the ""Friend"" left, I felt like Ive been slipping. My fear of failure and paranoia that people (including my advisorand especially other grad students) hate me and dont think I belong in the program has shot through the roof. The class I teach is a senior level lab, and Im the only TA whos ran it in the department, as the other experienced TAs have graduated. Ive had to spend this semester coaching a first semester TA through the course that I barely know myself, as Id only ran it once before. My work production has slowed to a crawl due to a combination of this and the fact that calculations we ran took almost 10x longer than we were expecting. Ive tried my best to muscle my way through it, but it feels like the floor is falling out under me. My office is right next to my instructors, and about a week and a half ago, Id overheard him talking about me and I feel like during my third semester review Im going to get dropped from the program. I had a panic attack in my office, but didnt tell him. I tried opening up to him a bit, and apologized to him last week but Im worried he mightve seen it as just making excuses right before the review. I honestly dont know what Ill do if Im dropped. I started seeing a therapist in December, and have mentioned this offhand to my advisor, but understandably he is relatively distant when it comes to personal matters like this.

I will put off doctors visits, ignore things that I should have checked out, and self diagnose things based off of endless reading.  I have   of losing my car, my home, not being able to provide for my wife and son, and requiring a costly medical procedure that I cannot afford if I do have things checked out. This   stems from the fear of being out of work and being fired by my employer. Im sure the male mindset of just toughing things out also comes into play, but the fear of being fired due to need of medical care scares me into procrastinating medical appointments. I think sometimes Im also afraid of being told I have a bad problem that will require surgery (another fear) or be something that is life altering.

455,charlesofthejungle,1.0,Drinking Routine,"Curious what you all think about this and it’s something I’ve been contemplating recently:  I really enjoy bourbon. The taste, the flavor, the burn, and of course, the way it relaxes me and helps me switch in to “me” time! I particularly like one brand and if they don’t have my preference, I’d rather not drink at all. That being said, if they don’t have it, I’ll just wait and have some when I get home instead. It’s my favorite part of closing down the stress of the day and moving in to relaxation mode for the evening. When I go abroad, I bring a few nips of my brand because honestly, I would prefer not to drink anything else, but I still want to be able to enjoy a drink after the day. Though I guess I would actually have something else? Maybe a small amount but definitely not much. Side note, i actually bring some food items with me when I travel too, for the same reason...I really like my daily routine and like to have specific snacks at certain times of the day.   I have 1-2 every day with dinner or while cooking. Sometimes I’ll have 3, but usually lose the desire to keep going after that (i never during the day or with lunch, unless there’s a rare outing or event that calls for it, otherwise, water only...I don’t even want it). On the weekends, it may be a bit more at night but max only 1 more (4 total), because honestly, I like getting buzzed, but not super drunk, and never blackout.   The conundrum is that I do have   sometimes, and while I love this routine, the anxious side of me is terrified of being called an alcoholic because I really do enjoy it so much and don’t want to cut it out of my day. So, the big question is, am I addicted, dependent or just really obsessed with my routine (I def have some OCD tendencies and like things structured to be the same every day)? I like it, it hasn’t really interfered with my life, and I don’t need to keep going once I’ve had a few (No need to clear the bottle), though we do all get a bit carried away now and then I suppose!  If you can’t tell, I’m extremely routine oriented, so no question, if I take a few nights off, I’ll miss it and probably crave it because, again, it’s like a favorite reward after the day.... I look forward to it! How do I know if I’m craving the alcohol or the routine? Does any of this sound like a problem? And before anyone says “if you have to ask, it is”, just know that   makes you think everything is a problem! Haha. I’m also realizing how crazy some of this sounds, but just know, I’m being brutally honest.

463,morbidbisexual,1.0,Some science to fight that irrational anxiety.,"❗Trigger warning: Ill describe my fear shortly, dont want it to scare you.❗   So my way of coping with   is ridiculing my fears and using rationality and logic to destruct them. Its like in Harry Potter where humour is used to tear down irrational fears except I rather use science than normal magic.   Like honestly, if it wasnt for free scientific research on the internet about   I wouldnt be in a good place. I assume some people feel the same and thus I wanted share some excellent truth about  . Im writing this post mainly to help fellow anxious people and also to distract myself from my ridiculous fears since my friends are asleep right now and I dont want to wake them.  So basically my biggest fear right now, mainly because of all the stress and   Ive been having over the past few years is that Ill lose my mind and turn into some Hulk like version of me and end up hurting anyone. Especially because sometimes my brain feels so idk electrified after stress that Im scared it might damage my brain. Which is as ridiculous as it sounds, especially considering Im a vegan and a pacifist who often cares too much about other people rather than himself.  So here are some truth about  :    Believing you are about to lose your mind is a common catalyst to a panic attack, where the fear of losing your mind and the changes the stress response make fuel each other.  But even though the fear of going crazy can be frightening, it’s not an indication of a problem with your brain, mind, or sanity. It’s just another indication that your body is experiencing a stress response and/or of a body that’s overly stressed.  People who have been under a lot of stress often experience this symptom.  Its important to note that there is no connection between   and going crazy. While it may feel like you could go crazy due to  , you actually cant. Its a physical impossibility.  Ergo, sometimes,   is like this thing that can make you think the worst fears even though a lot of these fears have no base in reality. For me it helps to remember that my fears are irrational and to look at the data that is out there.   For example, to get back to my fear. In the past 22 years of my life Ive never turned in the Hulk monster that I fear to become, nor am I in that state now and there is no good reason to believe Ill be in that state anytime soon. Ive been through worse panic attacks and Im still me, therefore my Hulk fear is very unlikely.

What if people stare and watch while I’m doing it?’ But once I checked how much longer I had before I would get to work, I just gave in and said ‘fuck it,’ and started going at it.

Prior to my start date I had a birthday party to attend, then the next day I had another birthday to attend which was my own.  I had one rest day where I was completely dead from going out and drinking. All my friends and family were so supportive and congratulatory towards me because they know how big a step this is for me, I havent been employed in a year and a half. Last night I went to be at midnight, which is not great but by my standards not the worst either. I woke up about 5 time between 12 and 7 for long periods of time and felt as if I was going to get sick, as well as sweating. I had my first induction session that lasted 8 hours. For a decent part of the induction I was fighting off a panic attack and not even focusing on what was going on. Finally we get to the place Im going to be working at and its covered in fluorescent lighting, which triggers the derealization I sometimes experience, but is my worst fear. I simply cant work in this area and even some of the other parts of the place are   inducing to me. I really dont feel up to the task.  I came home feeling soulless because I was so tired and anxious all day. I came home and my parents are super happy for me, but it makes me feel worse because I feel like Im going to let them down. I feel like Im going to let everyone down again. All my friends have showed me a lot of support and are genuinely happy for me and I feel as if I wont be able to work in this place. I cried for half an hour when I got home just thinking about this. Im in again for 4 days this week, all 8 hour shifts starting early in the morning. I know Ill get another sleepless night and have a day full of fighting off panic attacks, only to be placed in a section where the fluorescent lighting drives the stake through my heart and induces some nice derealization  I honestly have never felt so down on myself, I dont know what to do.",1554151857,1554151858,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b88sk6/new_job_feel_worse_than_ever/,False,False,0.0

I generally play it safe and would stay in my comfort zone far too often, which includes my once stable job. I always thought that if I put in the effort I would probably stay at the company until I retire. A change in management caused my sense of job security to drop and   spike. Many people have quit specifically because of new boss so I know it wasnt just me.

While I am not going to get fired anytime soon, the stress of an unhealthy workplace (boss) has made my life a mess.   The issue isnt just my current jobs stability either. I work in a niche field and job opportunities are relatively uncommon unless I move a few states away. That alone was enough to make my   spike even prior to the new boss taking over. I am not sure I want to do this kind of job anymore either; the pay is good but I am a rather burnt out. After a not so stellar annual review I got recently, I decided a change is required. I had had enough.   I have always loved to create things.

Ive tried over the years to explain the difference to her, using evidence and such. She shuts it down everytime.       My parents are not the type to go to a doctor or a therapist for help. I am homeschooled, so needless to say, I am isolated and have no clear and confidential way to reach out of a professional on mental health. I have not been diagnosed with an   disorder by a professional. However, through my research of symptoms and causes of   disorders, I am comfortable with saying I have   issues.     I get overwhelmed fairly easily. For example, I could be sitting in the living room, family members walking past me, perhaps trying to start a conversation. My heart will start racing, and I start feeling very uncomfortable. Like they are circling me. I normally escape to my room if I can. This usually ends in me being teary-eyed or zoned out for a long period of time. If I cant escape, I become irratiable and try to excuse myself to the bathroom.   I tend to rock myself back and forth in stressfull or overwhelming situations as well, which can be very comforting. Another tick that I have that Ive been trying to stop doing is picking at scabs or skin, or chewing on my lip when Im nervous. I chew on my lip way too much, to the point where its almost always scabbed and chapped. If Im in a situation where I need something to ground me and keep me from breaking, I tend to pick at scabs or skin in order to feel better. I know these are unhealthy habits and I try to stop them as soon as I notice they start. But its hard when your getting yelled at for something so miniscule, and your trying not to break down and hyperventilate and cry. Sometimes the easiest thing for me to do to feel better and keep my mind occupied in those situations is to scratch or pick at something.      In social situations I also get overwhelmed. I personally think that being homeschooled since 2nd Grade is a direct influence on this. Its gotten better throughout the years, especially if I can go out in public and not have to talk to anyone, but often I still come home with shakey hands and a splitting headache.      My   peaks at night. Lately, Ive found myself unable to sleep and restless until 1 to 2 am. My heart starts racing, and whenever I try to lay down to sleep, I immediantly want to get up and pace back and forth in my room. My thoughts tend to race, thinking about different things such as whats going to happen in the next 5 years to something that happened 5 years ago.     Because of my lack of sleep, I get stuck in this vicious, sleep deprived cycle. I am always tired. I wake up tired. Im never motivated. I dont want to get out of bed in the mornings because I dread what is going to happen. During my school day I can stare at my computer screen for long periods of time without even doing anything. I zone out easily. Once I come out of it I tend to break down and get frustrated with myself for not being able to concentrate.     Sometimes I feel like I need to run. Like that thump in your chest that you get when your playing hide and seek with your friends, and they are counting down from ten seconds as you scramble for a hiding place. But it happens so randomly. And the only way to make it go away, is for me to break out into a sprint in order to calm myself down.     (Also, just a disclaimer, Im not trying to say that I definetly have  . I dont want to offend anyone by assuming that I have it. But what I do know is that what I am going through isnt normal, and   is the closest thing I can link it to until I get a professional diagnosis. )  ",1554144760,1554144762,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b86voy/trying_to_get_through_the_unknown_vent/,False,False,0.0

They asked if I wanted to go to an installation that day and I had no idea what it was, and I panicked and said yes. The event also takes place on their birthday. Now I regret it. The installation is quite expensive to get into and I’m not particularly interested in those times of installations to begin with. I’ve been to a similar place before and I just took pictures of the other person and didn’t really enjoy myself. So I messaged them back saying “Hey, I need to budget more carefully this month so I may not be able to go. I’m really sorry about this! Maybe I can meet up for drinks later to celebrate your birthday!”   They said they already got the ticket in my name. So now I’ve said yes again as I felt obliged to go since they got the ticket, and it’s also their birthday. I should mention I am currently unemployed so money is an issue these days.

After my awkward answer to their question (something along the lines of “not in a while, the last one was last year and I was not seriously looking for another job at the time”), they shook my hand and told me they’ll make a decision within the next couple weeks after they interview a few others. I didn’t really feel a connection between us at all, and sensed little to no common ground. I keep telling myself I’m glad I went, but in all honesty I just wanna hide from the world. I can’t do that, I gotta keep looking and opening more doors. Maybe look into working with animals, which I love dearly and care deeply about. Idk. I just wish I weren’t so awkward.

514,Sixkittyhoe,1.0,Vertical Heterophoria and Anxiety,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text coming. Im on mobile and will try to break it up as much as possible.   Ive posted before about my   that came on very suddenly almost 7 years ago. I was fine one day and not the next. I loved driving, it was my ""think"" time. I was very social and going places and meeting new people.   One day, after a short drive down the interstate and while stopped at an intersection, I got very dizzy, vision blurred and I had a massive panic attack. Every time after that when I drove the panic attacks would come on almost immediately. After that, even being in a vehicle would cause vertigo, dizziness, nausea, panic attacks, racing intrusive thoughts and headaches.   Then I became unable to do my own grocery shopping and had to pay others to do my errands. I was miserable and isolated. I felt like an utter failure as a person and a mother. I eventually lost my job my house and my car because I could no longer drive or even stand to be in public without feeling awful. Lights were too bright and everything made me dizzy. Eventually I became depressed because of my isolation but I kept on.  Everyone I talked to told me I needed meds. Doctors said the same thing but I had this strong feeling that something was physically wrong with me, not chemically. For the last 6 1/2 years I searched and searched and nothing fit. I had never been in an accident, not had anything particularly scary happen, no head injuries.... so what happened?!   Last year while, again, searching for my answer I found an eye condition called vertical heterophoria. I got excited. Could it be my eyes?! I had all the symptoms and it made total sense. As soon as my husband got home we went to the local walmart eye center to have me examined. The Doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my eyes and that I should get my head examined instead. I am near quoting him! I cried all the way home, ugly snot tears.   Since then I kept reading about vertical heterophoria. It just made too much sense. I found out the your regular eye Dr cant diagnose this because there isnt anything wrong with your eyes individually. You can still see but your eyes are constantly straining.   I filled out a survey online for the specialist in Michigan and the next day I got a call. They had an office in Kentucky and wanted me to come in.   We made all the plans and went up there this past Wednesday. I was an absolute WRECK on the drive up there. Its a 10 hour drive from where we live and just a 30 minute drive is torture for me. God bless my husband and kids for being there to support me or I wouldnt have made it.   The next day I go in for my exam. They did 5 different tests and scans of my eyes. Then the Doctor did a few more test where I had to cover one eye and follow a laser on a scoreboard and read. He put these crazy looking glasses on me and we started figuring out which prisms I could see through. Almost as soon as he had the right ones in there I felt my mind relax. I was so calm! Before I had the glasses on I couldnt see the last two lines of the eye chart and the board I was reading off of looked weird. After wearing them just 20 minutes I could read almost everything! I had no idea my vision was so bad. He showed me a chart of something near and far with green lines where I should see and red where I did see. It was no where near where it should be. Im looking past everything! When he had to take the glasses off I got so dizzy I thought I would faint. My whole world spun around. I couldnt afford to get the glasses right then ($650) so I set up payments with them for over the phone since we live so far away. He told me for the ride home to cover 1 eye and that should help a little. A LITTLE?! I was able to sit up and enjoy the ride home! See the mountains and cities and traffic and I felt a little wobbly but I was calm. I probably said ""this is amazing"" 100 times on the way home.   Within the next couple of weeks I should have my glasses and the Dr said to wait 2 weeks for my eyes to fully adjust and then I could start driving. Im already making plans to take my kids fishing and hiking, to the water park and getting a job! Ive missed people! Once I have my glasses I will post an update.    The Dr told me that some people are so off balance that they walk in the office with a cane and once they have their glasses they walk straight out! Thats amazing! He also said that I was most likely born with this and as I got older I was less able to compensate and my eyes and brain eventually said no. Looking back, that makes sense. I had subtle symptoms since I was 18 (32 now) and never considered my eyes or even that anything was wrong, until I couldnt drive.   I hope this post reaches someone out there who feels stuck and hopeless like I did. Specialists for this seem pretty spread out but it is worth the trip and the money to feel better. To truly address the problem! It is all worth it.

My   is getting a lot better and at that moment that night, I felt really peaceful and happy. My friend decided that that was a good time to start ""grilling"" me on everything Ive done wrong in his eyes. He told me how I dont have a job, dont have a plan for life after college, dont do anything for myself, dont take charge of my life, that I have ""no empathy"" and that I ""can do better"". He said it in a way that was not empowering or friendly at all. He was basically telling me all the things Im anxious about and then criticizing me for not facing them. He is a hypocrite because there are tons of things he isnt doing. He isnt perfect. Yet he thinks he can sit on his high horse and try to grill me about everything Im anxious about. He assumed so many things about my life too. When I didnt agree with some of his assessments because, you know, he doesnt know shit about me, I suddenly ""wasnt listening"" and ""didnt want to accept the truth from anyone"". He told me that all my friends in our friend group hate me and that Im not doing anything with my life.     This came out of nowhere from him and he went into things that werent his business. I told him I didnt want to talk about it but he flat-out told me ""no"" and kept going. I eventually said I was going to leave if he didnt stop talking about it and he said ""fine"". I was really shocked by that because...dont you want to hang out with me? Dont you want me here because Im your friend? Or do you just want to tell me things that youve convinced yourself about me and not listen to me? I felt too anxious to call him out on his own hypocrisies, so I just sat there and listened to him criticize me for 3 hours. Its one of those things where I realized how fucked up it is only a couple days after.     I dont consider him a good friend. I think he is very toxic.

520,dtzo,1.0,Problem with language,"I think this is a case of self-fulfilling prophecy-type thoughts like I cant talk, I cant write, and then not actually being able to talk or write, as in, the belief that anything I write will not make sense if I let go, but then that letting-go not feeling like a possibility in that moment. This isnt strictly social since I get the same experience writing or talking to myself. I think about how crazy it is that people just talk or write and all the words make sense, and how perfectly in-sync what they say is to what they believe, how language just works by itself, in the same way breathing just happens, walking, all of that. In those moments, e.g. 20 minutes into rewriting the same sentence, I feel like I have to match a limited pool of words up to the meaning, compromise on the meaning rather than the language, when it should be the other way round. I lose touch with what I believe, I lose my thoughts, I make no sense AND I stop caring about making sense: following my own argument feels like a separate task. I start a thought and I cant expand it. I get anxious about meaningless words like the haves in wouldnt have had. I know what they mean, when to use them, etc. but so many of them at once make me cringe.      Im sure Im not autistic since I can read people fairly well. But when I fixate on language, a strange thing happens where people, everything, the truth, what is real, confuses me. Id prefer to think that this is a state of mind, and I can make it disappear sometimes if I hit on the right thing to tell myself and then believe it rather than something you medicate, but Im not so sure, and its also my default mindset, it lasts all day, has made talking in class impossible, talking at all, impossible, writing...this whole post was drafted too",1554142164,1554142165,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8698z/problem_with_language/,False,False,0.0

I originally chose the venting flair for this post but once I saw the one that said needs a hug it just hit my heart and I had to choose that one.  I dont know how to stop feeling this way. I feel so overwhelmed recently and Im just sitting here crying as I type this. I cant even talk to anyone about how Im feeling, even though I know they want to listen and help I just immediately feel so incredibly guilty for burdening them with my thoughts and problems that I just want to take back everything I just said. I feel so tense all the time, it takes me ages to fall asleep because I have constant worry that people I love are going to die. Especially my family, my boyfriend and my cats. Throughout the day and night I have these intrusive thoughts that something bad will happen to them, and Ive developed a kind of superstition that I have to pray and pray and pray desperately or else the bad thing will happen. Some might say that prayer would help with this  , but its become an obsession, Im not even very religious any more but my whole life praying has been the only way I felt like I had control over a scary situation so I guess I revert back to it. But I end up praying desperately and it sounds like begging - ""please please please please please Lord dont let anything happen please please"" and every night I have to run through a whole long prayer sequence praying specifically for every single person/animal that Im worried about, including myself because I have constant   that Im going to die. It drives me crazy having this begging in my head all the time, 80% of my day is spent either worrying about my family or doing this desperate praying. To fall asleep at night I have to watch youtube videos, even if Im exhausted I HAVE to have something to fall asleep to to take my mind off it.      Ive been struggling to keep up with my university work too because of feeling constantly tense and stressed out and mentally exhausted from all the constant worrying and praying. I have an essay due tomorrow (and its 8pm here right now so I am going to be up all night) that I just havent been able to do because my state of mind has just been terrible. The thought of not handing it in on time makes me feel 100 times more stress and is actually what just caused this panic attack Im busy having. There is an extension procedure but Im not sure if its too late to apply, and since I dont have any documentation from a therapist backing up my reason they might not grant me the extension. I just dont know what to do. I should probably go attempt it now, even if I write it through my tears and do terribly at least I will be handing something in.

Im on my 3rd year of university and I attend two classes at the moment, each once a week. Participation isnt mandatory, but I still feel like I should attend as much as possible to learn as much as possible and hopefully improve my grades this summer.   The problem for me is that I find it really difficult just to show up. It hasnt been always been a problem and I used to attend most classes without worrying the first couple of semesters. But whenever I think of going to class, I start to feel anxious, I start to sweat and get nauseous and start to fear all kinds of crazy scenarios like vomiting in front of everyone or passing out - which has never happened before, but still something that I fear will happen. I really dont want to make a fool out of myself or show my   to others.   This has been going on for a month or so now and each time I want to improve, but I usually end up getting so scared of what COULD happen in the classroom that I end up not going and just study at home instead. Im really afraid that its going to hurt my grades and that Ive already screwed up everything by not showing up.   I do go to therapy and I also have a mentor in which we practice using public transportation, but the classroom thing is still a major issue and I have trouble sharing my issues, even with my therapist.    My question is then: Does anyone else have this problem and whats your best method for actually going to class and getting a good experience? Im sure that itll get better once I can get myself to show up and make a habit out of it, but right now its extremely hard just to get to campus since I start to feel anxious and even physically ill before showing up at all.",1554138952,1554138953,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b859qr/how_do_i_attend_classes_again/,False,False,0.0

I pushed myself out of my comfort zone harder than I’ve ever done before, and done more social responsibilities than I’ve had to take on.  The first thing - I’ve had a semi-professional photography shoot for a project I’m taking part in. I had to meet in a part of the city that was very populated but that I’ve never been to before, with a total stranger but who had been contacted by a trusted person that works with her sometimes. That whole thing went so much better than expected, and I was glowing with confidence afterwards!  Second thing - I had to walk down to my local vets to ask if they can help me with a slight health problem my pet gecko was having. They couldn’t help me directly because they don’t specialise with exotics, but they gave me the contact details of a close exotic specialist vets that would be able to help me.  Finally, the third thing - similarly linked to the second thing - I ****called up**** that recommended specialist vets and got registered there with an appointment booked. Annoyingly, I’m going to have to rebook the time and day because I won’t actually be able to get there for then and I was put on the spot so I blurted out a time and date. However, it’ll be notice enough that it shouldn’t be a problem to rearrange, and the receptionist had told me that if I need to rearrange, to just call - so I’ll sort that out tomorrow.  Ughhhhh. I feel so drained from all these encounters, very tired emotionally, but I feel proud for pushing myself further than I have before, and getting things done. When I get anxious or stressed, I tend to procrastinate to hell and back so I can ignore my feelings (not the most effective solution), so forcing myself to do it sooner rather than later has been a relief to say the least.

542,Missdriver1997,1.0,Bullying and abuse. How its still with me 10 Years on. (Long),"Ive struggled with depression and   since i was about 13. I guess i have chronic everything  When i was 13 i was restlessly bullied physically, verbally and mentally by both females and males. It was so bad i tried to kill myself and the things they said and did i cant even think about now ( ive kind of blocked it out). The worst part was I was told to ""get over it""  and  was ignored by people i trusted, basically mentally abused at home too, by my parents. They only woke up to themselves when I had a mental breakdown. We have a close relationship now, but its hard to remeber it. The school only cared when my mum said she would stop paying my fees and remove me.   But the thing is I feel so pathetic and worthless even to this day- even if they were just 13 year old kids.. I have come to realise over the past weeks (Ive been in an extremely bad place nearing the end of my degree) that they have shaped me as a person and il probably never get over it. I have to face that fact. Ive been the same emotionally since i was 13. When I gave up. The only thoughts now i have are anxious ones. Ive tried 4 different headshrinkers, CBT. Group Therapy. Medication. Drugs. Herbs. Nothing works. Im still the same, even though ive tried so hard to be different and grow out of it.   Thats the thing i hate most. Even at 22, Im still an anxious, depressed mess. Im a loser.   I dont have many close friends. Ive never had a relationship. I dont think i ever will. I try everyday to be happy, to look forward to something. Ive never been successful in anything. I have to try really hard to be motivated. Most people my age have had boyfriends, even long term relationships, a close friendship circle to keep themselves occupied from the miseries of life. Ive never been able to have that. Ive tried really hard but I just feel so worthless I give up before i get anywhere. Every time Ive tried to work hard towards something, or someone nice has come into my life- ive lost it.   Its the same with my career and professional life. Ive been made to feel so worthless and dumb and ugly and everything you can imagine that i feel like il never have a career, no-one will want to employ me, il always struggle and be the same way. Ive only just struggled through university, something to keep myself occupied- but im not sure even what i want to do because i feel worthless, worthless worthless. Someone always picks someone else over me in every aspect of my life, so why even bother?      The worst part of it is losing your trust in other people. Asking why me? Why did I deserve it at 13 When i was totally innocent. It was totally unprovoked. The worst part was not just losing trust in people my age, but adults too. I felt like no-one cared. Like it didnt matter how I felt .  I probably should end it here.   Today, my bullies are jet setting around the world with their boyfriends and girlfriends, with stable-well paying jobs at 23. Theres no karma for them. They are happy and content with their lives. The idea that they targeted me because they had something wrong in their own lives at 13 is total BS and one of the worst explantations ive heard.  I know they dont even remeber me. They didnt even know my last name when they started on me. Im just a nothing in their lifetime and im certain they dont even think what they did was wrong, or even at the time acknowledged what they were doing.  I have to face the fact that they made me suffer horribly and they still make me suffer everyday. They still have a sort of power over me and even though its hard to say and people will say otherwise, Bullying stays with someone forever. For me its developed into lifelong depression and  .

I’m due to start a new job, which is also a university course in May. I didn’t think I was anxious about this, but maybe it’s what set it off?   I was supposed to be spending the day with my boyfriend in the town about 20 minutes away, but as soon as I got to the bus stop I had to come home.

He had done so in the past including a few times with a loaded rifle.  The last time he did so, he was online with a friend, the rifle was not loaded, but the friend reached out to her mom, then guidance counselor, and then we found out through the school.  Since then, he has been in intensive inpatient therapy, and now is in outpatient therapy.  He is doing well, scaling his days on a better than fair scale.  He says he feels better and behaviorally he is far more engaged with friends and family.  All guns, rifle and ammo were removed and are stored offsite and he does not know where.  Things were moving along fine until about a half hour ago.  I was driving to work and I got images of coming into his room and finding that he had shot himself.

Had another around the same time last December.   Recently however, probably a week ago, it was about 1am and I was on the computer playing a game, listening to music, the usual stuff.    Out of nowhere something snapped in my head. Like you’d see in movies. Every single thought possible came to my mind. From why my life is good and bad, who loves me and who hates me, why I do things I do, funny celeb moments, memes, future plans.. EVERYTHING. No exaggeration. I had to get off the computer and lay down, I couldn’t stop. I was out of control. I tried turning music up, tried distracting with videos, even tried watching porn in hopes it would just make it stop.   It wasn’t a normal   attack though or just the normal racing thoughts. Something was very strange about it. My chest kept getting hot with every thought. But I never “broke down” which felt worse than actually breaking down. I never got any relief like I would with crying/venting.    It has to this day been my worst experience and it’s a brand new symptom for me that I feel will put me in the hospital one day.

My vision is blurred nowadays from the lack of sleep, and my body is hyper sensitive to everything. Im constantly fatigued, and Im struggling to deal with everyday tasks.

It has only gotten worse.  It got really bad when I dated this guy for 5 years. Everything was going great for the first half of our relationship - we were that picture-perfect couple that everyone wanted to be. To keep a long story short, we had a falling out and broke up. We talked everything through months later and decided to get back together. I thought everything would be fine.   I was dead wrong.   He started physically abusing me. He started calling me every name in the book. He told me that he was the only person that would ever love me - he convinced me that my mother, my father, my sister, my brothers...all hated me, and it was an “obligation” to treat me right because I’m part of the family and it would be “f**cked up” to blatantly tell me that they didn’t love me. I was fully convinced. And I guess I just haven’t been able to shake it yet. He left me shortly after our 5 year anniversary.   Now, I am not saying that he is the reason I have   - I was diagnosed with it for far more reasons than this. This just made it that much worse.   I am now in a relationship of 3 months with this wonderful guy that takes awesome care of me. I couldn’t have asked for anyone better. But I catch myself, almost every night, not being able to sleep from  .   of him leaving.   that he just doesn’t love me anymore and questioning who would even love me to begin with. I have talked to him about it once or twice and he has reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, and that he loves me - but I still can’t shake it. I shake, I get nauseous, and I get that lump in my throat that tells me to cry but I can’t. So I just stare at the ceiling and hope it passes.   I have two best friends that I wouldn’t trade for the world, and I am even convinced that they don’t like being around me anymore. I’ve isolated myself, I’ve stopped answering phone calls from them, I’ve bailed on them. I feel like an awful friend, but I feel like I seriously just can’t freaking help it. I’ve mentioned it to them and they’ve also reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, but it’s like there’s a devil on my shoulder telling me that they’re lying.

575,pKievit,1.0,The Cornered Animal,"A cowardly dog is trapped in the corner… all its life its been beaten and the only reason it survived was by running away, hiding and whimpering. But now its cornered, for the first time it cant escape… it now has no choice but to fight viciously for survival. This illustrates the desperate way that our damaged subconscious mind tries to hold on to power and control over us in an attempt to “protect” us and keep us “safe” from harm. In our childhood the only choice we had was to run, hide or cower in fear. Now, as an adult we have dug deep into the depths of our psyche and we now understand our dysfunction… however, our minds still do not trust us to take control of matters that involve our emotional safety… as a result, it attacks us with convincing arguments that if we try we will fail, theres no point in trying, fighting back leads to pain, give up, run, hide, cower… our minds fill us with fear, dread,   and depression… every and any debilitating emotion to stop us from doing what it feels is dangerous. That is, to confront our fears and try new healthier ways to cope and live. But now our subconscious mind is cornered, theres no way out… you have chosen to refuse to give up, its you and the cornered animal and only one of you will survive. The problem is, that YOU are the cornered animal, and the only way you walk out is by taming the beast, domesticating it, letting it know that you are in control, letting it know that you are grateful for it keeping you safe the only way it knew how for so many years. But now, YOU are in control and you need to let your mind know that you will protect it now, and that you will not let bad things happen to it again.  Recovery vs Fear of the Unknown   For those of us with any sort of childhood trauma, fear of the unknown is debilitating. Our childhood trauma taught us that certainty within any given situation is the most important thing. For us, uncertainty was seen as certainty that bad things would happen. Therefore in our lives today, as bad as depression and   is, we are familiar with it… and trying something new,  or trying to do things differently  may fill us with more fear and apprehension, which in turn keeps us trapped in our familiar prison of depression and  .  For me, this is a basic outline of my history.  Initial childhood trauma lasting 18 years.  Maladapted coping mechanisms formed:  •	Denial •	Suppression •	Distraction •	Subjugation •	Enmeshment •	Underdeveloped sense of self  •	People pleasing  •	Approval Seeking •	Validation seeking •	Substance abuse •	Self pity  After the initial trauma lasting 18 years, it was followed by over 20 years of living a false, people pleasing, codependent identity which ultimately culminated extreme and debilitating depression and  . For me, recovery meant:  Making a start at refusing to deny, suppress and distract myself from the fact that I have a problem.  Making a start at refusing to be subjugated, people please, approval seek or validation seek.  Making a start at giving myself praise, validation and approval.  My maladapted coping mechanisms of people pleasing, co-dependency, approval and validation seeking all gave me a measure of pleasure and good endorphin release, albeit disfunctionally... therefore, as I started to eliminate maladapted coping mechanisms I started to experience less positive feelings and more stabilized and constant feelings of depression.  Understanding and Acceptance  Once you understand, in as much detail as possible, the precise links between your childhood trauma and your current behaviour and feelings, you might be lucky enough to transform your feelings of depression,   and sadness into anger against the injustice of life itself... anger is a not to be underestimated important step to reach because it is a necessary driver of change... but even then you will not automatically experience joy, peace, calm and happiness... in fact, this type of appropriate anger can and will lead to cynicism, bitterness and resentment, and so it is important to move to the next step in your recovery which is acceptance.  Acceptance.  Acceptance of what happened in your childhood, acceptance of how those things made you who you are today, acceptance that you were and are not to blame for any of it, acceptance that you cannot change the past, acceptance that you are who you are in the now, acceptance that in the now you are the best version of you that you can be... acceptance of the fact that you now have determination to slowly improve your person and your life in frustratingly small steps, every day, day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year... acceptance of the resolve to not give up come what may.  The thing is, most likely, your mind does not know how to feel safe, positive and happy in a normal way. At a default subconscious level your mind will want to revert back to denial, suppression, distraction, a desire to find meaning through enmeshment, self pity and substance abuse or another well established self destructive behaviours. The sad fact is, is that your mind does not yet know how to cope or exist in any other state other than sadness, depression and maladapted and dysfunctional ways of coping and feeling better about things. Therefore it is important to teach your mind new ways to cope with feelings of negativity and new and healthier ways to experience joy, pleasure and happiness... this will present a real challenge for you, because even on a conscious level, you may simply not know how. Initially, you may simply have to go through the mechanical motions of doing things that you know are suppose to make you feel better... like going for walk, doing something artistic, outdoor activities, social activities, listening to music that is happy, not jaded or angry music, or depressing love songs etc.  At times however, we may need to go back and feel the fullness of our pain so as to explore and learn from it, to heal it through resolution... but we cannot live in a state of pain. We may need to revisit feeling angry over the injustices of our life, but we cannot live angry...   So balance is required, because although we want to live in a happy headspace, this does not mean slipping into denial, suppression and distraction.... it means that we have felt the fullness of our sadness and anger... we accept what we feel, we acknowledge our past and with that acceptance and acknowledgement, we now choose to engage in positive activities to teach ourselves how to be happy in a healthy way.  This being said, the first stage to reach from depression and   is anger, because you are making the switch from flight to fight, but you dont want to stay angry or you will be consumed by cynicism, bitterness and resentment... so you need to move on to the next stage which is resolute acceptance...   After that you need to establish a new set of personal boundaries, or a realm, or scope of life that you want establish to live within... to find joy within... to find personal fulfilment and meaning and purpose within. Establishing a new life within which you want to live.  Acceptance is important, but it is important to know and get well acquainted with and pursue the healthy things that you want and enjoy in life, that will help you to cope and recover further.   An important thing to remember is that recovery will not mean that your life will ever be as though your childhood trauma never happened... it will never be how it was before you were debilitated by   and depression... however, just because this may be the case, it does not mean that whatever life you choose to create wont be wonderful.  For me that means pursuing things like art, exercise, weight loss, happy music, lego, movies, gaming, fishing, camping, creativity, appropriate self love and self respect through proper personal hygiene, care, grooming, dress and helping others to better their lives purely for the joy of giving without falling back into co-dependent or people pleasing patterns.  At this stage you may question why? Why bother? You may fear that doing or pursuing these things is ultimately pointless and little more than distracting yourself with positivity. This may be true to a degree, but not entirely, and you will need to be able to recognize that your resistance to pursuing these things amounts predominantly to your own deep seated fear of failure when you try to effect change for the better... your mind may still be trying to hang on to the familiarity of depression and   because it knows how to disfunctionally make you feel better and will always try to pull you back to familiar things to your own detriment because it is convinced that you will be better of with the dysfunction you know, than the uncertainty of doing something new that might fail.  Regret nothing, feel ashamed over nothing, feel guilty over nothing, the past has made you the good and insightful and thoughtful and compassionate person that you are. To regret, feel shame or guilt is to regret that you are who you are, to feel shame and guilt over who you are... which is little more than self hate. Life did not give you the love, nurturing and protection that you deserved... so accept that you are who you are due to a life that was not of your planning and control and was ultimately indifferent, random and cruel.  Armed with this acceptance, move forward and choose to be who you want to be... choose to do what you want to do... choose to live how you want to live... refuse to go on allowing life to happen to you... take charge and become the architect of your future... even if its hard... even if its scarey... even though its unclear whether you will fail or succeed.         ",1554121858,1554121860,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b81q3t/the_cornered_animal/,False,False,0.0

581,coolestestboi,1.0,"Overcoming social anxiety, fleeting nervousness, and workplace anxiety","**Disclaimer:** This is not a replacement to therapy, or medical treatment. This is just a handy mental tool which can be treated as a coping mechanism.      Use a technique called semantic conversion. It’s pretty straightforward and useful in social and office settings.   Social   has a powerful core colored by the fear of being judged by others.  This manifests in all kinds of thoughts and an   action-reaction. I say action-reaction because thoughts can cause   and   can cause unnecessary thoughts. In fact, at times, the two are just one homogeneous blob of discomfort.  Semantic conversion has 2 steps which handle the feedback system of thoughts and physical   as well as behaviors such as social avoidance.   Step 1: Mindfulness labeling   Step 2: Constructive rephrasing  **Step 1 Mindfulness labeling:**  We are, by default, not very aware of our own thoughts, emotions, surroundings, and perceptions, biases, and physical responses.  You begin by noticing the details. Ask the following questions:   1. What is it about the situation that is making me anxious?   2. What are all the emotions I am feeling?   3. Who are the thoughts related to?   4. Do you actually know what people are thinking?   5. Do they have a real basis for forming any judgment?  **Step 2 Constructive rephrasing:**  Now, articulate your thoughts and emotions with precision. It is important that you aim for precision. Learn new vocabulary if you need to. Suppose your feeling is captured by the thought ‘I feel like shit,’ mindfully label all the details and articulate it into something like ‘I feel ignored or judged because there is something wrong with me or I am dressed inappropriately.’  Add the emotional context- ‘I feel like an overwhelming spotlight is on top of me. This makes me conscious, self-aware, and critical.’  Once you’ve articulated your thoughts, it is time to rephrase them into something actionable. For example- I need to address this feeling and do something about it. Something that is in my control. Let me observe and see how others are dressed. Let me see if there is any real evidence of me being judged. I feel like I don’t know what to do, I should learn the skills.  This change is actionable. You can do something about it. This will help you **gain control**. You need it, and you \*are\* in control.

I could have written programs, applied my in-class learning to my own projects.. heck I could have built something for my long-term.  Does all this need completed before I get some null time? I havent proved myself incapable (yet) but holy heck I always feel like I am hanging on by a thread and talking myself out of doing something productive is becoming more and more persuasive.  I didnt want to talk myself out of missing the first day back of lectures, but there is no way in heck I will be able to operate on &lt;=3 hours of sleep. Though only two classes, I work an internship on campus between those for a total of 8 hours straight. It will be the first day I miss and the professor in charge is understanding.

So I’ve had lifelong  , got much better for a while without medication (not fully but no panic attacks for like 3-4 years except for rarely) and now in the past 6 months got worse again.

We have been together for a couple years, and when we first met and for the first year of our relationship I was still in my “lower  ” phase. But then in October / November of 2018 I started having daily panic attacks again  and derealization / depersonalization again. After taking the lexapro, it has gotten better but is still pretty bad. And I can tell my boyfriend is pretty upset about it. He hasn’t ever liked it but when it first started happening he was more empathetic and trying to be understanding and worried for me. Now that it has gone on for so long I can tell he’s getting upset at me. He knows it’s something that is extremely hard for me to control, but he said to me today “I just want happy times” and when I asked him to clarify he said it just seems like I can’t ever enjoy anything because of my   (which is true and literally one of my fears— that I will be so scared to live that I wont).   For example, yesterday was really hard for me but I pushed myself and we went out to a little festival and rode those electric scooters.

However today, for him he brought up How anxious I was and how I wanted to leave like 20 minutes into us being there.

However, the attack made me realized how stressful some pretty significant things in my life are right now.   To start, I’m a teacher in one of the worst possible states to be a teacher, Arizona. I hate my administration but a job is a job and I’m working without one of the certifications I really should have through a loophole in the system. I don’t have the certification because I have terrible test   (shocker) and keep failing it. I have plans to keep trying until it is passed but it costs $95 each try.  Next, my hobby is expensive. I own a horse. While I do so in the cheapest way possible, it is a terrible hobby to have with such a low paying job. Without the horse, I’d be pretty lost mentally. I normally have him partially leased out to help with costs but I’ve been unable to find a lessor and It’s been over a year without one...  Lastly, I am having trouble finding a roommate. I had to get out of a bad living situation in a very short period of time and the only place that I found to go where I would feel safe was a few hundred dollars out of my price range. I had a roommate which was helpful but she relocated to a different state for school. Since my rental rate is high the rate to rent my spare room has to reflect that and I know that that is what is keeping people away.  I really should have a second job, as most of my coworkers do. Some work their second job on weekends and others work an entire shift after school somewhere but I just can’t bring myself to do that as I’d have virtual zero down time which I know I need to help stay both physically and mentally healthy.",1554096596,1554096596,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b7xwo4/anxiety_attack/,False,False,0.0

When I was at college I would be so self conscious when I was doing my work I would never ask for help and would always turn the screen brightness down and angle my laptop so no one could see what I was doing even though I knew no one was watching and when someone was watching i would just completely stop working until they were gone.  I hate talking about my self and my emotions in fact i hate talking to anyone about anything because i always overthink it and end up saying nothing and not contributing to a conversation. This is often misleading to most people who dont understand me as they just think Im not interested and have nothing to say when really I have so much to say but by the time I finished going over it in my head its too late and everyone has moved on. This makes every interaction really awkward especially if its only me and one other person . There are a few friends that I feel more comfortable around and will at least engage in a conversation with them however lately most of these people have moved on. So now how am I supposed to meet new people when the few people i feel comfortable around no longer bother with me. I have only ever discussed my   with one person and only talked about it because he bought it up its like no one else even knows I have   which makes it even more uncomfortable for me.  Lately Ive been trying to reach out more but everyone seems to always be busy and I dont want to sound to pushy or desperate so I usually just leave it. I will start typing a message to someone but wont actually send it because I overthink it and even when I am sending a message reaching out to someone I will be going over every word so many times even to the point where one word wont sound right in my head then I will Google the word to make sure its right even tho I known the whole time  its right. And it doesnt stop there even after I have sent a message or said something to someone I will be thinking it over in my head.

The concept of therapy kinda scares me, but I know it would make me feel better. My dad was really sympathetic and said that it’s okay that I don’t know what to do in regards to after college stuff, and that I’ll figure it out.

656,loverlane,1.0,Currently applying for jobs after taking a month break.,"For three hours have I redone my resume and applied for a few retail stores so I’m taking a break to post on Reddit for a few.  tl;dr - I served for 3 months and started having minor episodes, which increasingly got worse. Walked out after a major episode, and took a break from working to focus on college for a month (or two?) *questions asked in end*   So my last job I was a server for an extremely busy corporate restaurant. I trained for about 30 days (extra time, never served before) and was on the floor for 3 months. My last 3 weeks while serving, i started having minor episodes i could brush off in the back room, easy. After a few of those minor episodes I realized that these are the most episodes I’ve had working, or in public in general. The episodes gradually increased in intensity or how long they lasted. The last few shifts I had to take 5 minute breaks every few hours (in that job, you don’t get breaks like that, lol.) I never let my managers or coworkers know I was having trouble with   on the job, I didn’t keke with anyone the whole time I worked there. It would’ve helped if I had a manager to go to.  Last day of work. I never did put in a two weeks notice. It was a Sunday shift &amp; I came in at 2:30pm when it was dead. I had one table for 45 mins but it felt like HOURS. As soon as i got the table, I got their drinks and spent 10 mins having an   attack in the bathroom. Every 10 minutes for an hour I was there, I had to excuse myself somewhere. I ended up walking out as soon as I closed out their check and never came back. Not the best way to go out, but also f*ck corporate restaurants.  I had a previous job as a supervisor last year, and I worked at that company for 1.6 years. I got super comfortable with everyone there, knew the regulars and every high school in the area went there, so I had absolutely 0 problems with rushes or customer interaction.  I took a break from working to focus on college, and in the mean time my car racked up $4000 in repairs in the course of 4 weeks. My semester ends in a month and two days, so I’m hoping by the time I’m finished I’ll be able to handle a job again.   I’m applying for retail jobs that are slowish in my city, starting at part time and an increase of hours of the weeks.  I have 1 month experience in retail and almost 2 years experience in food, so most retail places I’ve applied within the last couple of months (i’ve been job searching since i started that shitty server job) haven’t reached out to me. I’ve had 2 interviews in retail and they were both duds.   I’ve considered applying for factory jobs, but considering I have no experience and personally a female my size probably has no business in a factory.. I have half a year experience of management but I’m 19, companies are probably too hesitant unless i start at the bottom and work my way up.  So, what are ways you have been able to counteract your   in the workplace? What could be some generic job positions that have some customer interaction but not overwhelmingly too much?

Let me give you a start on what happened in my class that resulted in me feeling like this.  Back in first year of college, me and 2 other friends received our first academic policy offence from an at home assignment (it was TOTAL bs since everyones had to be identical).   Fast forward to last wednesday, during a test, i was doing my test and i had my phone in my pocket, i guess my teacher saw that- and he came to me and hes like “do you have any questions? I trust you. I want you to know that. Dont worry if you dont knwo things, because i kno you kno things” and then he walked away.. so im like bru he literally thinks im cheating so i got rlly scared and put both hands on my desk - then after he walked around and he looked at my mc and he told me to fix a few answers.. i handed in my test and hes like “are u coming to class next week for presentations” and im like yeah... NOW IM WORRIED AS FUCK HES GOING TO GIVE ME A ZERO AND TELL THE BORD I WAS CHEATING .. if this was to happen i can fail the course and get kicked out of my program and/or get suspended and again get kicked out of my program.   I feel so scared for this and i will feel like such a failure in my life - my family will hate me for it - and i just dont know what to do with myself. I wont know for sure till Wednesday if the teacher will contact the board for this situation.  Many of my friends are telling me that im in the clear and that he wouldve taken my test right then and there, that he wouldnt have helped me with mc, and that he wouldve notified me right then and there .. i didnt cheat, but now im just terrified for my future in the program.

673,GenusSoNora,1.0,Anxiety regarding my health...,"Hoping to find some advice on how to relax. Also looking for reassurance that everything will be okay. It is a bit of a long winded story, so feel free to skip down to the TLDR!  So Ill try to keep this as short as possible. I (F25) ate lots of sweets as a kid, skipped some nights of brushing my teeth, and started to grind my teeth when I was in college a couple of years ago. I wore a mouth guard on some nights to try to combat it.   I went to the dentist back in the summer of 2017 after not going for 2 years. They told me I had taken some damage from grinding my teeth. I expected it. I was hoping there would only be cavities, but I was told I needed a root canal w/ a crown on a molar. They did it that summer, and did another root canal w/ a crown on another molar of mine half a year later in January 2018. I needed time to save money for other teeth they saw problems with. Fast forward to January of 2019, they crown another of my molars (no RCT on this one). I was told I needed another tooth crowned. I was so distraught at the news. I told them I was going to seek a second opinion from another dentist.  I visited another dentist about 2 weeks ago. He did a full oral examination of my teeth, telling me which cavities needed to be retouched a little. Nothing big. He then did an x-ray of my teeth and informed me the first root canal I had done a year and a half ago hasnt healed yet. He also told me the crown I had done recently back in January of this year is not a good fit and is bulky (This could explain the pain I was feeling from this tooth for the past two months, sensitivity to cold drinks and hurts when biting down on food).  I am mostly just looking for the light at the end of the tunnel here. My main concerns are that my root canal doesnt heal properly and will have to be retreated (more money and more pain). If that doesnt work, it would have to possibly be extracted and Id have to get an implant (tons of money). The crowned tooth that is hurting me right now would have to be potential recrowned. If that doesnt work, Id have to get another root canal...   I know its not the end of the world. Im lucky I can save up enough money for the treatments I need now. But I am so stressed about how much more I could potentially spend on my teeth. Im worried about all my root canals failing in the future and needing to replace them all with implants. I am just so worn down, and my thoughts are constantly about my teeth. ""Will I be okay? Will the root canal heal? Do I really need more of these?? When will they fail? Will my other cavities turn into crowns and root canals?"" Every day I am online looking at dental forums and reaching out to dentists, asking for answers. My   is on full blast as Im stuck in the middle of all of these procedures. My mind hates not knowing what is to come. I am thinking of the ""what ifs"" and am creating worst case scenarios in my head...  But amidst my thoughts, I realized I also needed to vent and to have a good cry as I type this out. If you fully read this, I cant thank you enough. This is what has been on repeat in my brain for the past couple of months. Ive been crying everyday as soon as I get off of work. My   has been terrible. My body has been so tight. My throat gets a bump in it that I cant burp away. I cant catch my breath. If anyone has any advice on how I can be positive, how I can try to get my mind off of everything, or if youve been in a situation like this before, I would love to hear from you. Even if its just a simple ""feel better"", it would help me immensely. Thank you.   TLDR; I have had two root canals w/ crowns done, have a crowned tooth, and have a couple other cavities.

684,ir8221cu,1.0,Dealing with abandonment issues?,"   Hello, hope everyone is doing well--spring is here, you best be doing well ;)! Today Im looking for advice about how to handle abandonment issues. Long story short, I had a really chaotic upbringing and its left a toll on my adult psyche. Im currently 19 and a freshman in college. This has been an underlying issue for me my whole life, but Ive never really taken heed to it until I got into personal development &amp; meditation; now, ive realized, this has been destroying me life! Having this issue has been so omnipresent that I had no idea I even had it!      &lt;!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If you dont have abandonment issues, Ill briefly fill you in; if youre reading this because you too suffer from it, go ahead and skip this section.   Ive destroyed relationships, friendships, and infinitely indefinite amount of potential relationships &amp; friendships. Basically Ive observed that it comes down to two separate domains, each with its own set of issues. The first domain of issues is the idea that people hate me, dont like me, and that theres no way they could actually like me. unbelievably stunning, beautiful, and intelligent women have made their way into my life and Ive destroyed all those relationships because I just didnt believe they were actually into me. Out of 25 kids I was one of the only two chosen to be initiated in one my schools fraternities, but I dropped it today because I felt like theres no way these people like me &amp; they hated me. The second domain is walking on eggshells: ""now I did it."" This thought controls my mind. When ever I say anything, do anything, etc, I instantly feel like ""now I did it. That was it. Everyone hates me now. Now theyre leaving you for sure."" Basically thats my life story.   \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;  Anyways, freshman year was an awesome experience! Ive met so many people, hooked up with a lot girls, etc, etc, but its all very shallow... Im lucky I suppose, I dont have any social  , and Im a pretty confident guy. Im able to meet people, laugh, vibe, and enjoy each-others presence--girls, guys, teachers, adults, bosses, etc--but when its time to make a real connection, thats when things go really bad... I become cold, aloof, antisocial, etc. I imagen I hurt peoples feelings because Ill get so bogged down by this idea that they dont actually like me, they hate me, that Ill stop waving &amp; interacting with them all together. Im sure I leave them vexed &amp; hurt. (but I dont know if they hated me to begin with)     Im self-aware enough to watch this phenomena happen before my eyes: I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. What makes me the most angry is I cant distinguish the difference between this mental fabrication from actuality. I cant tell if someone actually hates me because I did something wrong, or its just a delusion my mind is projecting. (walking on egg shells again)     I wish it was just as easy as not paying attention to it, but its imbedded deep into my psyche and I dont know how to fix this issue. I really like myself, like Im happy playing this character in the human experience, if that makes sense. This is destroying my life. Have any of you recovered or found solutions?

694,bbuttercream,1.0,Struggling with a weird form of anxiety. Help?,"I will start by saying I’ve struggled with   since my late teens (16+..), at the time I didn’t realize what it was, I thought I was just shy and depressed. I’d sweat through everything I wore when out in public and always thought it was my deodorant. Now that I’m 24 I realized I was struggling with social  , it’s gotten a lot better but it still pops up once in a while resulting in me having a nervous stutter, I still sweat a bit here and there when I’m in a particularly stressing situation but for the most part I’ve been able to push myself out of it after 8 long years of struggling to figure out what I was dealing with. I have experimented with mediation but have a difficult time making it a habit (I plan to). When in public I have used some grounding techniques to help alleviate the  , it helps usually.   Now, my problem is something that meditation - exercise - breathing exercises - distraction don’t help. Nothing has helped.   A few months ago, something happened where an issue would pop up, and I would fixate on it over and over. I lost 7 pounds in a week because I couldn’t eat and I would just feel like throwing up 24/7. I couldn’t workout because I’d get so nauseas and start panicking. After I’d resolve that issue (usually by talking to my boyfriend as well as my best friend 100x until I can tell it’s driving them insane), it would go away and I’d be relieved that it was finally over. These things I was focusing on were not current issues for me, they were things I’d done months or even years before this started. Once one issue went away something else came up, this went on for over a month and my boyfriend wanted to leave me because I wasn’t acting like myself. I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t listen, I could barely perform at work and I was an emotional mess. My best friend also has become noticeably distanced from me ever since this happened and we don’t talk even half as much as we used to. I went to see a therapist who ended up going on vacation and while she was gone I got onto Wellbutrin. Eventually things felt a lot better and it seemed to finally all be over.   I chalked it up to growth as a human, and needing to process my past behaviour and move on. The Wellbutrin made me very sick and I didn’t like the idea of being on medicine anyway so I stopped taking it.   Now fast forward about 5 months and it’s happening again. I’m writing this now from a coffee shop - attempting to study - fixating on things that aren’t real issues magnifying them to 100. I don’t want to drag my boyfriend into this again, he has finals coming up and we are going through a rough patch as it is. I can’t focus and I need to be studying but my head is throbbing, my hands are soaked. I feel nauseas and cant breathe properly and my heart feels like a bumble bee.   Last time this happened a couple months ago, I almost lost my relationship, my relationship with my best friend took a critical hit and I also worsened my relationship with my only parent I have left who is alive because they needed my support and I couldn’t give it.   Tl;dr my   is literally making me suicidal. I can’t live like this.    Also, another weird thing that happens is my brain fixated on a word and no matter how much I try not to think of it that word is the only thing that pops in my head.

704,throwawayokf,1.0,Unnecessary surgery,"Hi,     I am not really sure where to post this but Im not sure how I am supposed to move along, if I can.  Approximately a year ago I did a jaw surgery that was not necessary, yes, you heard it right.     It all started a few years earlier when I was taken off my braces and the process started of wearing a plastic attachment for my teeth for a few months ahead. I was sloppy with it and the result ended in a gap between my teeth, quite a big one.     Jumping forward approximately two years ago I once again started to wear braces and the process of fixing the gap started. For some reason I did not want to tell the dentist that it was most likely due to me being sloppy with the plastic attachment, I am not sure if I felt ashamed or similar. The issue with me is that I have a really hard time to be honest about my feelings and this is not the first time I have been in situations where I have just accepted it, for example being bullied, being quite lonely, left jobs due to social phobia. It feels like eventually I am gonna realize all the stuff I never dared to tell people and feel loads of  .     As I sit here and write I feel nauseous and that I have let down family. That I do not have the courage to tell people how I feel or when I feel bad keeps getting me into situations I do not want. Luckily enough, the surgery was quite minimal and I look pretty much the same. But it is not about that, it is about taking an issue that I do not dare to tell family or others and elevate it to something like this.     I have no clue how to move forward from this, almost every evening I think about it and it makes me feel so so bad about myself.",1554073241,1554073244,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b7u083/unnecessary_surgery/,False,False,0.0

717,YetiSuplex,1.0,"Dealing with rude landlord spikes my anxiety(confrontational anxiety, irrational worry) Dealing with him twice this coming week. Any Tips?","First time posting here so forgive me for any lack of format or errors.  Back story, 35/M Have always tended to worry (a habit I picked up from my mother as a child), had a panic attack that landed me in the ER in 2013. Diagnosed with GAD at that time, the last 6-7 it has fluctuated getting better for months only to spiral harder when confrontation arises, or I feel my boundaries are being crossed. My GF of the last nearly five years has a difficult time handling this as she has some form of depression (undiagnosed).   We moved into an apartment last July and right away the Landlord was a bit rude and invasive, first week here experienced terrible constant  , feeling we were being taken advantage of or something similar due to his rude, uncaring, and intrusive nature. Any interactio/conversation was always awkward and difficult this is true for my GF as well she totally agrees with me on this.  Things seemed to get better after that.   (Aug/Sep)Then we got a notice for preventative quarterly pest spraying in our apartment that required us to move all furniture away from the walls. No specific time of time just anytime in that window we would have to immediately vacate for a minimum of 2 hours. Not a big deal, dealt with this before, he was somewhat cordial and my   was relatively low.  Fast forward 3 months(Dec) and we get a notice again for spraying, we opted to pay the $25 refusal fee since it was such a hassle last time and our cat has health issues. Again no qualms or issues. Low  . During a minor repair in January, he brings the uncashed refusal check and makes some comment about saving our ass. I brushed it off and didnt let it get to me. A real star moment for me I felt.  So we get another notice March 1st and decide to refuse again because its an option. He argues with my girlfriend that we cant refuse everytime, its in the lease (which its not) but accepts the check.  A few days ago March 28th we get a notice for spraying Monday April 1st between 8 am-12pm, this time its just our apartment, where it mentioned a refusal fee it says in big red letters ""Mandatory: No Excuses"". Instantly my   reaches critical mass and I panic, vomit, and cry for an hour or so.    I start my new job Overnight on April 1st so would be sleeping when they would be needing to spray.  Sister says to just talk to the landlord about it. Landlord isnt reachable over the weekend unless its an absolute emergency.  Get a notice on Saturday for a routine inspection of appliances for Friday at 1pm.   My girlfriend will be at work both times so I am going to have to deal with him on my own.  Any advice or tips for dealing with someone like this? I have wasted my Sunday crying and worrying over this and I am just sick of feeling helpless. I have thought of giving notice or being vengeful and saying something rude back to him. But its a waste of time.   If I continue to live here I am going to have to learn how to deal with him. But currently its so crippling.  I am so sorry this is a lengthy read.  Any advice or help is deeply appreciated.

Next week I got a major exposure event. In a earlier post I mentioned my dad is having pancreas surgery out of town.  (1 hour drive from home)  My mother, sister + husband, and I are going to be around him for support.  We booked an hotel room for 2 nights.  Im extremely nervous and full of  . Already.   Because the surgery is not a choice, my presence is neither.  This is a thing I have to do, an exposure I cant escape.  My fears arent really about the surgery, because the surgeon is very capable, he is going to use a newtech robot assistance and the tumor they are going to remove hasnt proven to be cancer for 100% certainty. (My dad did have three surgeries before. All of them removing cancer tumors. Those were in his colon and two times liver, so luckily they arent taking any risks on the development of this found spot on his pancreas) Im more afraid of being outdoors, visiting the hospital, feeling claustrophobic, or afraid I have to vomit and cant find a toilet nearby. Its about sleeping in a hotel, or getting myself into panic attacks, and not being able to calm down. Or the fear no one can calm me down, and that I remain in the panic attack and it will drive me out of control. Get into a mindset of despair and hopelessness.   And being afraid of being the extra emotional weight my family has to carry around while were already at the top of emotional tolerance...  So! I need to prepare myself as good as possible! Does anyone have any tips regarding preparation for exposures?  - Im gonna try to be rested and relaxed as possible this week. So that my body can handle the adrenaline.  - Im going to exercise a bit. Dont have a good condition, wont have it either in a week time, but you know, dust a bit off, clean the rust in my joints, stretch out and get this tank body moving... - I was thinking about writing down some motivational quotes, for the times in fear. - get a simple mantra going - I am going to drink more water - Meditate some more - rewire the breathing patterns. Self awareness in breathing - already carrying plastic bags folded in my jeans in case I need to vomit (it gives me a bit more confidence) - already bringing down the daily dose of Lorazepam I take each day, so it will be more effective next week in case I need to increase the dose because of  . - already got my music in Spotify on my phone. My favourite band Nirvana, grunge, stoner, noise and alternative rock but also soft rock in case the hard rock makes me more pumped up. - gonna take some new photos of our two cats so I can look at them whenever I want. As mascottes. - gonna search for some easy literature to read.  - taking a notebook in case I get inspired and I want to write - buy a powerbank for my phone (because its also gonna be my TV if I want to watch anything - gonna do a nofap this week until Im back home, because of post orgasm sickness (also did post about this earlier)   Any more tips?

728,anne2630,1.0,Why is it so hard to make friends as an adult?,"I posted about this awhile ago and didn’t get much response.  I’m hoping to get some advice!   I know that I tend to overthink and over analyze EVERYTHING.  So I’m aware that most of this is in my head... I could still use some advice!   I struggle with having social   ever since I was with my abusive ex.  We were together for almost 6 years and broke up 4 years ago. I thank god every day that I was strong enough to get out of that relationship but the effects of the abuse are still on the forefront of my every day life.  He led me to believe that every conversation or interaction I had with others was pathetic and he criticized everything that I said and did.   I was selfish and stupid and no one liked me (his words not mine).  Before dating him, I would have considered myself an extrovert.    Once we broke up I thought I’d go back to my outgoing and friendly self without any issues.  Boy was I wrong.  I find myself avoiding every social situation and when I talk to others I’m constantly filtering what I’m saying or I worry about how I came across after the conversation. I’ve become EXTREMELY introverted to the point that I almost always decline invitations to social events as I am overcome with crippling   at the idea of it.   I don’t have many close friends as I’ve grown apart from the friends I grew up with.  I moved out of state with my ex after a year or so of dating so the only friends I had nearby where his friends.  After our breakup I literally had no one.    I finally got a steady job and made a close friend at work.  We were close until we both got different jobs.  Honestly, we started growing apart maybe a year before that when she and another friend we worked with both had their kids.  I felt like they got closer and I wasn’t a part of the “club” so I got left out of certain things.    Anyway, her and I have been struggling to keep in touch.  I feel like it’s very one sided with me constantly being the one that has to reach out. More recently, she forgot my birthday.  My one close friend forgot my damn birthday.  Meanwhile I attend every birthday party for her son and was the first one to wish her happy birthday this year.    I know I shouldn’t keep score but it the reality of it is, I’m just not as important of a friend to her as she is for me.  We haven’t talked seen each other in person for months and have maybe texted twice in the last month or so.  She did send me an invite to her son’s birthday party recently and honestly, I don’t want to go.  It’s an hour away and I know how she operates at those kinds of events. I’ll be lucky if I even get two minutes to talk to her.   I know I’m probably overthinking it and I was going to bring it up to her, but I avoid conflict like the plague.  I do want to let her know that I was hurt about her forgetting my birthday and that the lack of communication and effort on her part makes me feel awful.   This is a tough age.  I’m 32 and I’m beginning to realize that the majority of my friendships have been lost to marriage or motherhood.   In reality, I know those relationships obviously weren’t as strong as I thought they were otherwise they wouldn’t fizzle out so quickly.   I know plenty of people who are married and have kids that have managed to maintain friendships so I know it can be done.   It just feels like it’s a club that everyone else is in, and because I’m not married or have kids, there’s no reason to include me in things.   Aside from the specific friend issue, I want to learn how to be more social and to stop worrying about what others think.  I want to finally make more friends and get my social life back.  I just don’t know how to make friends. When I was younger it was easy because I met people at school.  I’ve tried to make friends at my job and have made one kind of close friend, but she never wants to hang out and now she’s pregnant with her first child.  She assured me she’d still be around after having her daughter but time will tell.  Plus she has a close group of girlfriends and I feel like I’m just her work acquaintance.  She’s also very flaky and will often interrupt me during conversations or will ignore me when other coworkers are around.   I’ve thought about using bumble BFF or another app to find girlfriends but it feels awkward.  I found my bf on tinder which is great but it feels weird being on an app looking for friends.

734,eyebrowshampoo,1.0,The curse of anxious listlessness,"Hi everyone,     I just wanted to talk about the type of   that has plagued me for a long time. It is a combination of depression and   that I call anxious listlessness. I really havent talked about it much with anyone, but want to write some of this down because writing things down helps me figure out what to do. If anyone else wants to add some specific things they experience with their  , go right ahead. Its totally open.     Here is what my experience is like:  * I feel guilty for doing nothing, but have no energy nor desire to do anything.  * I cycle through things to do constantly, but the heaviness in my body and mind talk me out of doing anything appealing almost immediately.  * The thought of doing anything productive is riddled with so many what-ifs that I become afraid and never even start.  * The thought of talking to anyone about it is terrifying. When I do, I keep my head low and mention it in passing.  * Seeing other people being productive or having a hobby makes me feel worse. My spouse is very involved in a hobby, but I mostly jut watch and wish I could care about something that much. It makes me feel useless. * I crave something, but dont know what it is.  * Everything is so temporary right now and it makes it a hundred times worse. I am relocating across the country soon and have a job lined up, which put me on cloud 9 for a few days. Now, I am trying to figure out our living situation once we get there and there are so many variables and so many things dependent on other things, I cant focus on anything else but cant get anything done with the information I have. Its an obsession tied up in things over which I have no control and its like torture. The temporary feeling in everything makes me feel like I cant move forward with anything in my life until this insane puzzle is finished, and I cant even find the corner pieces.  * I feel tired all the time, even if I havent done much.  * When in doubt, I just clean and cook. Or pack. I already packed so many things in the house to prepare for our move and I dont know what to do with myself now. Its just waiting. I cant start anything big and new since Im leaving soon, but I desperately need something to keep me engaged in the meantime. I just dont know what. My home is clean, food is in the fridge, and what I can pack early has been packed. I have no energy or room for anything else and just want to fast forward. I just pace around my home, afraid to sit down in fear of being perceived as lazy, desperately looking for something small and engaging I can do. I cant find anything anymore. * I just want it to be rainy and awful outside so I dont have to look out the window at the beautiful, sunny day and feel guilty Im not outside doing something. Today its cold, so I have an excuse to stay inside. I miss being outside. I backpacked Yosemite a few years ago and used to camp and hike all the time. Now just riding my bike takes a conscious effort. It feels like recreational activities take up precious time I could be spending doing something more important, even if there is nothing more important to do. * Every time I do something productive, I feel like its never enough. Last week, I cleaned up all the trash in the yard, planted grass seed, raked, and planted flower bulbs. Yesterday, I did all the laundry, meal prepped for the week, swept and mopped all the floors, and had a nice dinner with my spouse. Today, I took my dogs for a long walk, cleaned my kitchen, scrubbed the sink, and made breakfast from scratch. I still feel lazy and useless - like I havent done enough and never will. But theres nothing else I want to do. * I dont have any desire to spend time with friends and family anymore, even though I used to be more social. All I want to do every day is be at home. I secretly want to do nothing, by myself, all the time, but my spouse coming in and out of the door from the garage makes my heart race. I know he doesnt judge me or care what I am doing or not doing with my free time, but my mind assumes everyone else judges me as harshly as I judge myself. He can be engaged all day doing something he loves. I can barely find the energy or motivation to do anything I enjoy. I only do things I have to do and nothing I want to do.  * I feel guilty for random things that dont make sense. Yesterday, I mulled around Target for an hour and bought a $6 shirt on clearance with my own money. I hid it when I got home, feeling like I didnt deserve it or that I was being irresponsible. I felt bad going there without any need. I just wanted to walk around as an anonymous person somewhere. When I came home, I felt like a shallow person who fills voids with things - like a $6 shirt.  * I try to remember my therapist telling me to give myself a break, let my mind rest, accept that it is due to a chemical imbalance and that I should not be ashamed of myself, and let inspiration come to me naturally. It never does. It just gets worse.  * I spend all day, every day breathing shallow breaths and tensing my entire body for no reason and its almost impossible to stop, even with meditation.     Ugh. Its frustrating. But I still have hope everything will return to normal someday.

738,nush19,1.0,GAD makes me question my relationship with my boyfriend CONTINUOUSLY,"Hi! I’m 25 (F) and I’ve been diagnosed with GAD for 9 months but have pretty much had it my whole life. I’ve been in therapy since I got diagnosed. It helps a whole lot and I’ve gotten a lot better at managing my   in almost every field except when it comes to my boyfriend. I often randomly get anxious about him. I could be having a good time and feeling great and out of nowhere I get very anxious and I feel it in my chest and I don’t know why. Then I start digging for a reason and start questioning whether or not I actually have feelings for him, whether or not he’s the one and whether or not i really want to be with him. Sometimes it gets to the point where I start telling myself that I’m not even attracted to him, that he’s ugly and that I want to be with someone who’s more attractive.   He’s honestly the sweetest, nicest, most amazing and patient person I know. (Apart from my mom). So it’s so shallow of me to think that way. And he’s not ugly at all. He’s pretty cute actually. But these are the thoughts I usually have. Sometimes at those moments i also can’t remember any positive thing about him. And every tiny thing he does, starts annoying me.   We also have this issue where either HE feels like he has to hold in his feelings to make sure I’m okay when I’m anxious about whatever thing or I’M the one trying to make sure he doesn’t find out that I’m anxious so he doesn’t feel like he needs to hold in or so that I don’t bring his mood down by being negative. And we can’t seem to find a way to better this issue. So that also sucks. Because every now and then he has to tell me that he’s feeling bad again because of me and that I’m bringing down his spirits by being anxious and him not being able to help me. Which I understand completely. But as a result i start holding it in which then makes me annoyed with him and makes me distance myself from him. I only recently realized that I do this and told him and he was very sweet and nice about it and I felt better afterwards. We even agreed that it’s probably better if we break up to give us both a break but we don’t want to because we love each other.   This conversation happened a few days ago. And previously he’s already told me twice that he doesn’t know if this (us) is what he wants because of the issue i described above. And every time we have a conversation like this, I get very insecure and start being more affectionate and mushy gushy towards him and don’t feel anxious about him either. But the second I realize we’re okay again, I start getting anxious. Like just now, we were hanging out in his car for a few minutes and everything was totally fine and I was happy everything was alright again and I suddenly got anxious while we were kissing. And it confused me. As usual. I just don’t know why this keeps happening. I feel like, maybe it’s because I want to be 100% sure that he is the one for me and that there is no one better out there for me. But this is obviously impossible. I constantly go back and forth from absolutely not wanting to break to not being sure if I want to be with him and not knowing whether  I have feelings for him or not.   WHY? And how do I stop this? Does anyone have any advice? Because I don’t want to keep feeling this way. It’s so exhausting. Not only for me but also for him.

746,AlexologyEU,1.0,Kids on the street makes me inordinately anxious,"Hello there and welcome to my first post, I tend to be somewhat verbose which is not really the best way to capture attention on a reddit post! I do hope you can indulge me.      Im doing great recently, Ive been in therapy for a year dealing with depressive thoughts and my wifes nervous breakdown last year (shes doing great now, better than we ever could have hoped!), but my   is getting out of control. I did delay dealing with my own issues during my wifes recovery but shes f-ing eel and Ive found the space to come to terms with some of my problems.     Ive got back on my feet this last year, back exercising, took up writing, become a house husband when off work since my wife works longer hours,  starting to get ready to socialise again, its been great and Im feeling good. But let me explain whats happening with my anexity:    I live in a slightly rough area and my house is situated on a T junction on street with allot of children. The area outside my house is the hangout for quite a few of them. Two years ago they were younger and would knock on our door and run away. We became targeted by one girl in particular who would encourage the kids to mess with us. That girl is gone these days and most of the kids have grown up and only play football (though the sound of the ball also makes me anxious). The knocks on the door have declined but still happen occasionally, kids are kids so I cant really blame them but its driving me crazy.      At this point ANY noise on the road sets my   off and can lead to my heart beating out of control, Butterflies in my stomach, sweat, dry mouth. Symptoms vary depending on if the kids are amassed or if they are just passing. But my fear of the noise is entirely dominating my life. Every waking moment Im thinking about what could happen, I wake up and I think about it, I go to work and think about it, when Im going to sleep etc etc etc. I even check the weather to see if it will rain so I can relax.      The other aspect is that I play games to relax, to escape the world, and my tower is in the living room next to the window facing on to the street. So if Im gaming for an hour or two the kids can see that Im there. It has occurred to me to move my rig to the back of the house to get away from my trigger but I feel the root of the issue might be worth exploring.     I think Ill stop here and answer any questions that may arise. Without a doubt Im suffering and its getting out of control, and Ill be talking to my therapist about this but any and all advice is welcome. Finally if I have left out any pertinent information please let me know. Thank you for your time.

749,akitchenwall,1.0,Terrifying experience at the grocery store,"LTL FTP, I had to share my experience this morning with yall, because I’m not sure most other people would understand why this was so horrible for me.  I shop at Aldi, and for those of you who aren’t familiar, it’s very quiet there (used to be my favorite thing about shopping there, now I’m not so sure) and they usually only have one cashier lane open ( they just go really fast).  I’m usually very fastidious about my grocery budgeting and list, to the extent of using my calculator app as I shop to add my purchases in real time. My little family of 3 is poor, I’ll just say it (but we work hard and I’m proud of us), so this is very necessary. Well, my husband and I recently both got raises at our respective workplaces, so idk I guess I was feeling lower middle class or something and strayed from my list slightly (a convenience cleaning product, and a snack) and wasn’t calculating what I put in my cart.  I get to the cashier and every customer in the store gets in line behind me. I load my full cart onto the conveyor and he starts scanning.   I notice about 2/3 of the way in that I’ll be over my budget (literally every dime in my account) so I pull out a few items and politely ask him to void them, he does with no issue. He finishes ringing my items, I see what I think is the total with tax, I need to take off something else. I do ( I’m starting to get really embarrassed at this point) while the whole line of probably 15-20 ppl are staring at me in angry silence. He’s gotta call the manager to approve my voids. We wait for that, manager comes to turn their key then immediately leaves to open another register. I get the total, it’s still over. I start panicking on the inside, there’s still a huge line of ppl behind me staring at me and now the cashier is getting short and impatient with me. I have to pick (now essential) items out to void. We have to wait again for another manager to come approve my voids while I’m beet red and just trying not to cry. I finally pay for my remaining groceries then have to bag them in front of all these pissed off people and feel them all staring at me as they check out and leave (having to walk right past me). When I got to my car, I realized I’d been holding my breath and was too lightheaded to drive away before I lost my cool and started bawling in the parking lot.  I’ve always been mortified of this happening to me, it’s really been one of my worst case scenarios since becoming a parent. I’m so glad my baby wasn’t with me, and I’m proud that I made it through without losing it publicly, but now my body hurts so bad and I just want to hide for a few weeks.

757,sammyjamez,1.0,Social anxiety and struggling to cope when you are pushed away,"I do admit that I am not exactly the most adept when it comes to social skills. I know that I have social   and I have had it for years.      Sometimes I behave in ways that one would describe as odd or unorthodox - I can sometimes be very blunt and direct and honest, I can sometimes be very quiet and reserved, and sometimes I can just make the big leap and introduce myself or simply just jump into someone elses bubble or discussions without going into the formalities first because it is an anxious and awkward thing to do.     Then again, I still remind myself that there is no clear why of describing ""good"" social skills because everyone behaves differently and everyone has their own way of expressing themselves.      But that being said, the thing that irritates and scares me the most is when I am pushed away or given the silent treatment or not communicated with for a while or worst, being ghosted.      I know that you will not connect with everyone and I know that different people have different preferences and will react differently on how you act and have their own priorities on whether they should give that person a chance or just behave on their own instincts or unconscious biases and just avoid that person because he/she is too odd or that there is something off about them     But I realised that this happens all the time irregardless of how I approach myself or irregardless of how geniune I try to be or honest or whether I make an effort to fake it until I make it.      And this not only pisses me off because I hate it when people just do not have the balls to say it out front that they do not want to talk to you or just did not connect with you (I know that not everyone has the courage but I still find it as a shitty excuse to leave someone in the dark), but makes me so damn self-conscious about myself and how people see me and especially how I see myself.      Social   often keeps on the edge over every tiny little detail that pops up in your head, whether the worry is geniune or just an over-exaggarated delusion or a simple problem that you go into it too deeply. And every time this happens, I go into worry overboard and makes me wonder whether I really am as much of a weirdo or whether the approach would have been better if I did a bit differently or whatever ""what-if"" scenario you can think of that puts you in a state of rumination for hours even though it does not get you anyway.     It becomes very personal and filled with angst and worry and sheer depression and sorrow which puts me in a constant loop of continous increase in my social  , refusal to interact with others, sheer over-thinking and over-analysing every tiny little detail to the point of a sheer burnout, and wondering why I have not been able to contact with anyone which fills me with shame, regret and embarassement.     It is annoying, frustrating and just damn right tormenting. I know that this is all done by myself and the only perpetrator here is me, myself and I alone. But it is really damn hard to convince yourself to get a grip about this especially when this involves on how you think about yourself right in your very core of your soul and how you somehow paradoxically are used to being alone or used to this storm of emotions and   and torment (and I mean this in a somewhat healthy way, not in a learned helplessness kind of way) even though there are those moments where feeling lonely and anxious just feel like you are carrying so much weight. I know that to some extent, this is all in my head even though it actually pretty real and feels very geniune and intense but damn it it hurts ",1554057101,1554057102,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b7qylz/social_anxiety_and_struggling_to_cope_when_you/,False,False,0.0
758,Franco-Cozzo,1.0,I cracked and I'm finally getting help.,"For as long as I can remember Ive known something was wrong. I am so good at outwardly projecting such a calm demeanor that nobody would have a clue. I run a successful hotel, have to look after huge departments simultaneously, have a huge amount of responsibility on me at all times, and you know what? That doesnt make me anxious in the slightest. Its when Im alone, when Im not busy, not at work, not needing to be the man, when my brain is able to tangle into such a goopy mess it can take days or weeks to clean up.   I cracked. My parter was going to meet me somewhere after work, she had contacted me to change location, I hadnt received the message. I waited for 30 minutes, tried to call but she was on the phone and wouldnt answer. Messaged and called again, nothing. I can feel a huge irrational frustration start to build up, my leg is tapping, breathing fast, scratching at the cafe table. I get up and knock over my glass of water, people are scrambling to help, I can handle this, I always handle this, leave me the f*ck alone. Whatever this is, it began to take me over. My vision starts to fade. I get a message saying shes just on the phone to her mum and shes waiting at a different cafe, that she didnt hit send and that shes sorry and shell see me soon. Problem solved, right?  The minute I sit down at the new location I start to cry, I start to panic, choke on air, sweating, my partner has never seen me like this and Ill never forget the look on her face. Im telling her Im fine, Im telling her to be more diligent about where were supposed to meet, Im beginning to gag from panic. Im so embarrassed Im trying to leave but she is running after me. What if she found out I wasnt the man she thought I was? That I am letting a reschedule make me act like this?  I cant believe this is happening, Ive always been able to bottle it, always. Ive never let anyone see it. It was my secret. My partner is now crying calling an ambulance, it must look like Im dying.   I booked in for my first appointment today with her guidance, wish me luck.

Usually she has us go over the test close to her desk, and ask her to clarify if we had issues with anything. So I sat close to her desk took out a bright purple pen, and an empty scrap paper, since I didnt get mine back from her, going through the issues I had with the test, and redoing them on the scrap paper with the bright pen. I was pretty shy to go up while other people were they so as I was waiting I would listen to her clarifications to other students and use them to solve the problems on my own. The plan was to solve it on the scrap paper and hand it back in with my test.     Next thing I know she loudly says pikipiki21, put the pen away and come see me, while shaking her finger and head, and everyone turns and stares at me. So I put it away and wait, and go see her after, explain what I was doing and she tears off a piece and lets me keep the rest.

774,___itsurgirl,1.0,I’m always on edge and I’m so fucking over it.,"I’m sooo exhausted(F21). I’m always on edge for no reason. And my poor boyfriend really cops it all.  I get angry if he’s late to coming to chill? Like it’s only 20 mins or so but it really bothers me. I have like time management issues. Like for me it’s okay to be late to things but if someone’s late to hang out with me I get so frustrated???? Like I’m so anxious when I really shouldn’t be. I love him but fuck does he annoy me so much. He’s kinda disorganised and lazy at times and doesn’t see that sometimes I need someone to help me calm down and just create an environment that will settle me. When I’m on edge and I need something and I don’t get it I’m soooo angry and just become so stand offish. And half the time I don’t even know what I want????   Sometimes I think it’s bc of my whole life drama with my parents. My dad was super flaky on the family I legit saw him like only a little, and when he was home mum and him would just fight.   Ever since my dad left (10 years ago) my mum went through a lot. (She had a rough childhood bc she was the only girl in the house and her dad was a shitty man and her mum was a proper European wife who stood by her husband). She’s depressed but she does her best.  I try to keep her happy and do as much as possible for her so she’s in a good mood it’s really worth it bc she’s really crazy when she’s upset or angry.  Sounds so dumb but like if my mum is on edge so am I. If she’s upset I’m on edge. If she’s all good then I’m all good. My sister (18) is kinda a bit of a troubled kid. She doesn’t care about much but her nails friends and makeup. She’s got no aspirations and just is so angry at the world. So when she’s in a mood I’m on edge. If my cat jumps the fence for a long period of time I get on edge. If I don’t complete my bedtime routine I get a shitty sleep and I’m on edge the next day. If I don’t have my eye mask or earplugs in a dark room with no sound I don’t sleep well and I’m on edge.   I need to be in control of everything. This is my only coping mechanism that works for me. But I want it to change bc I can feel my boyfriend is finding me sometimes to be a bit of a princess. But I also love being a princess. I want to talk to him about this but i feel like I’ll probs have a mental break down in front of him and he won’t be able to handle that. He’s got enough of his own problems as it is.   I’m so sorry if this doesn’t make sense to you I’m having a really hard time explaining how I feel atm.

So I usually have bursts of being worried (I havent had them in a while) but this week Ive been pretty stressed with all the school work. Apart from palpitating and from wanting to cry every couple hours I think Ive been okay.  Anyway, throughout this day, while studying for exams Ive been weirdly nervous. Maybe because I wasnt chatting with anyone online (I have this weird thing where I think my friends will hate me if I dont message them daily) but Ive been convincing myself  Im just overthinking.  Yesterday my friend called joking about how he ""needed me"" and that I had to go the coffee shop they were at with my other friend. (I was kind of panicking, I dont know why) Basically, they wanted me to buy them food or something.  The conversation ended with him saying that he just wanted me to say ""no"", since I always succumb to things people tell me to do and stuff. I get that he was helping me.  Chatted for a bit with them before going to bed. This afternoon, while I was asking for help with a question, he said that my friend was mad at me. I chatted her, to no reply (she replied at our other group chats).  Now Im thinking that Ive done something wrong. I dont know if theyre joking (theyve pretended to be mad before, I actually cried in school that day) or if I fucked up again.  Ive fucked up so many times before, done shit to them that I still regret and is probably the reason why Im still scared. Im terrified of getting pulled back into the same cycle, this cycle is the reason why I keep fucking up.

797,MrEpicWynn123,1.0,How to build self esteem after 6 years of Pure OCD,"Hi guys and girls, hope you’re doing well. A quick summary of me and my life, in 22 and I’ve suffered from pure OCD for 6 years with varying degrees of intensity. Over summer I started a relationship with the most beautiful girl in the world but since then my OCD has spiked as I care about her so much, I’ve worried what if I have ED and it ruins the relationship, I have tinnitus and I’ve worried what if it gets way worse and ruins the relationship, I’ve been worried I’m gay and don’t realise for the past few months, now I know these are all not true as I know my own pattern with Pure OCD I recognise the signs. And when I say worry I mean going over things in my head every waking moment, battling my own head, it is truly exhausting, I’m in CBT but I’m on a break as my therapist has had to take time off. I can feel it slowly wearing me down.  And now the main question, I know I love my gf and she’s super attractive but this constant questioning own mind and fighting myself has destroyed my self confidence. Outwardly I’m a very confident person, I’m one of those people you’d never expect to be suffering, a gym goer, social, makes everyone laugh and always smiling. But it’s getting harder to hide as I’m no longer always smiling so my gf notices more and more. Anyway, how do I build my self confidence? This constant battling has me feeling worthless, the constant fighting my own head about my relationship makes me feel like I’m not a good bf. A bit graphic I know but I’ve always had regular sex, either daily or once every two days, but now I’ve lost all interest in sex, porn or sexual stimulation in general which only serves to worry me more. How do I build myself back up? I feel if I don’t have sex then it’ll ruin the relationship but then that’s putting too much pressure on myself, along with the other OCD reasons that take me out of the moment which makes sex more of a test for myself rather than something to enjoy.

Joaquin Phoenix’s character says “I’ll make some sandwiches”, okay that sounds simple and easy. The young child instead says “I want spaghetti”, okay that’s a little extra work but nothing difficult. Mel Gibson then asks each family member what they want to eat. *Uh oh*..   The girl wants *Spaghetti*  The boy wants *French Toast with mashed potatoes*  Joaquin Phoenix wants *Chicken teriyaki*  Mel Gibson wants a *Cheeseburger with extra bacon*   At this point I’m already picturing the nightmare going on in the kitchen. All that food, all that mess. It’s stressful enough that aliens are invading. Now you have to prepare and cook 4 different large meals!? Where did Mel get the chicken for the teriyaki? the beef for the burgers? the sauce for the spaghetti? the taters for the mash? did Mel already have all the ingredients for this extravagant feast?

(Slightly longer post)   Ive moved into a new house around 5/6 weeks ago now and that means a whole new kitchen to cook in- now I have vaguely been been diagnosed with   and depression before, vaguely because the doctor didnt like giving out disgnosis even if she then gave treatments for it and it had been the depression that had been seen to and not the   but back to the main topic- the cooker I now have is a gas one and its new with its own teething problems like putting food too far back means the food is going to get burned and combine that with the *very* sensitive smoke alarm this house has then it ends up going off near enough every second time someone cooks something.  About a month ago I decided to splurge out and buy myself some garlic bread to make for lunch (new job, new house, low finances) and the tray I put the pieces on just normally ended up quite close to the top grill bit (the oven, oven part on the bottom doesnt really work well anyways so we stick to the grill) and put it in for around 7 minutes or so before the smoke alarm started going off and taking the garlic bread out the whole one side of them was pretty charred but undercooked overall. So now I had burnt, undercooked garlic bread I had to bin even though I had been looking forward to it, a smoke alarm screaming its head off and a meal I had to skip since I had enough set aside for each meal exactly.  Since then Ive pretty much avoided using the whole oven, the hobs on top are bearable enough but with a whole mess of thoughts of I dont want to waste more food / I dont want to set off the smoke alarm again / and most irrationally just having images of the oven exploding because someone may have forgot to turn the gas off and then tried to ignite it (which Im aware is stupidly unlikely) Ive ultimately reduced myself to a diet of microwave ready meals on days I work (4 days a week now) and packets of pasta to make on the hob as well as toast which has so far resulted in me losing about 10kg in the time since the garlic bread incident(so 10kg in little over a month) . Id been overweight for years now so this isnt exactly a bad thing but its absurdly unhealthy and Im not sure how much longer I can keep avoiding such an important part of the house.

We went on a break in November for a month and a half and havent done any sexual things since then. Since Christmas I could tell she has been happier but on Friday night after a really nice dinner we were getting into bed and she told me she felt a little anxious, we spent two hours in tears talking over things which we always do because it usually makes her feel better. But then yesterday she rang me and said along the lines of ""I cant keep doing this anymore, I am exhausted with it"" (talking about the  ) and because her   is tied to intimacy and I am the only one she expects to be intimate with we broke up. I completely understand this and obviously want her   to stop I just wish we could do it together, but so far we have tried and failed. We have said we will keep in touch because there are no hard feelings but I want to be there when her   stops so we can maybe try again.

826,_tterraG,1.0,Prom has driven my anxiety to what seems like an all time high,"Im a high school senior and Prom is coming up but just thinking about it makes me stomach-curlingly anxious. For starters I dont have a date, and the one girl Im close with is going with another person so if I were to go itd most likely be alone. I do want to go to my Prom, but going alone seems sad and im afraid others will think that its sad too. Im also feeling pressure from parents to go as theyve ask me many times as to what my plans are. They seem like their expecting me to have a date and other people to go with, and in general just a joyful Prom experience.  It seems like no matter what choice I make, whether that be skipping my Prom or going alone, it will feel awful. Its been the only thing on mind lately, and every time I start to think about it I feel a sudden feeling of dread. Thinking about it sends me down a rabbit hole of my social existence and makes me feel alone as some outcast. For as long as I can remember Ive been an anxious person, and there have certainly been things that have come up in my life that have increased that feeling, but Prom and just the idea of it, with all its expectations of a once in the life time experience has driven me to near daily panic attacks. I just want it to be over and done with.

I started taking Seroquel awhile ago and it would give me the worst nightmares Ive ever had, I stopped taking it after about a month but the dreams didnt stop.   Every night I watch all my closest friends die in horrible, painful, terrifying ways. I work with all my friends so the setting is always at work and its starting to bleed into my actual life.   For example in my dreams, my boss will go to the deep freezer and wont come back so Ill go looking for her and find her frozen to death in the corner of the freezer, staring at the door. Now in real life whenever she runs to the freezer Ill get a massive   spike and will literally set a timer to check on her.  Others die via meat slicer, stock pot, murder, knife accidents and 1000 other ways.  I bought one of my coworkers a knife sheath because I kept seeing her die from getting stabbed by her own knife.  Its really starting to effect me at work, I havent told any of my friends about it in a while because I think they were a little weirded out that I watched their death every night, which is fair.   Im never able to do anything. I try so hard to save them everytime and I cant, no matter what I do. The blood keeps coming and I cant stop it. Ive added so much shit to my real life medical kit in my backpack because Im scared all the time. Scared of losing my closest friends, even though none of it is real.

When I started, I joined a special group that was working on support issues, and so there was no need to share updates with colleagues who were were working on unrelated things. That group has since dissolved.   When I started joining a scrum team, I was so nervous that I took 2 paracetamol tablets (whether it really calmed my nerves or was placebo didnt matter). However, I found that it was impacting my health, so I stopped using it.  Luckily, it was a small group, and I was fine with around 4 or 5 people. Then, when they started adding one or two more, that was when I started getting anxious again. I would get the usual physical symptoms as it gets closer and closer to my turn to speak.  Then I had a panic attack. I had to step out of the group, grab a cup of water, and got back to talk.  I then made an appointment with the company psychologist, who first advised me to talk to my scrum master to excuse myself from the daily standups, as I work through my   issues.  This was last year. I havent been joining the standups, and doing my updates via email or Slack to my tech lead since then.  Is anyone else in the same or similar situation?

I know reddit probably isnt the best place to ask for help but honestly, I dont have many friends and the ones I do have are cookie cutter, dont really care, stay friends for appearances and for the occasional chat friends.  Im just completely taking a nose dive. I have been doing so well for the past 7 months, give or take, and I havent had any episodes like this. I recently broke up with my partner because of the horrible crap that we kept going back and forth about, but I felt it was for the best. I had more time in the past several weeks to play games I enjoy, watch TV, Ive applied for several jobs, and I moved. I moved in with my grandparents which Im not very much enjoying but hey you have to make do with what you have.  The impasse Im coming to is that I feel like I have just done a complete 180° yet again. It doesnt happen as often as it used to, but Ive been a part of several Discord Servers to make friends because I dont really understand how to socialize in person, the intricacies and the dos and donts of making friends, and I just left them all because I realized that Ill never really feel like I can even interact with anyone.   It gets worse: throughout my life, I have struggled with relationships, because when I meet a suitable partner, I care and love them and cherish them. I try to make them feel special and desired and loved, but at a certain point in the relationship, they always show their true colors and I am the one who ends up getting hurt and manipulated. I know that people have told me I should wait longer before committing to someone, which I understand, but with the events that transpired with my ex recently, I am kind of done. Sex doesnt appeal to me like most people anymore, its been too much stress and hassle and I am always doing something wrong in the other persons eyes and they make it known. And I cant look at the opposite sex with favor and passion and love anymore, I just look at them as an opportunity for hurt or a friend, but then we go back to the first point. The thing that Im scared of is if this happens with everyone how its happened with my love life. If I kind of just give up altogether on making friends or socializing with people because I dont have this special social aspect that people have to be able to understand what people mean and the intentions behind words.  I just dont really know what to do. Ive been exercising a lot more recently, Ive been undertaking art projects and Ive RSVPd for a meetup in less than a week, but I dont understand what Im missing with the few friends I currently have for them to be able to make time for me. Ive tried making plans with friends on dozens of occasions and they always flake and never tell me what happened why they couldnt say what was going on that they couldnt make it, they dont reschedule, they dont even shoot me a text to cancel, I just dont hear from them.

847,Paralle_,1.0,Worried about my wife's anxiety/panic symptoms after she stopped using marijuana,"Sorry in advance for the long message, but I could really use some help.   My wife and I live in Denver, and we recently stopped eating THC-infused gummies after about a 6 month period of consistent use (started consuming only a couple times a week and moved to every day).  Its been a little over three weeks, and Ive dealt with some major  , lack of concentration, and general unease as a result of stopping. Since this has happened to me before in high school after stopping--although not to this extent--I havent been too worried. I know itll just take time. Its my wifes reaction, however, that has me concerned.  A little background information: My wife and I are very close. Weve been best friends since we met, and usually sort out any miscommunications with ease. Especially the past 8 months or so things have been incredibly smooth and easy going; my wife and I had worked through a lot of our emotional misinterpretations caused by our past and had very open communication.   Starting when we stopped the edibles however, there have been some dramatic changes with my wife. The first week, for example, she was very quick to get incredibly angry and say hurtful things (she has NEVER done this before). I figured it was an effect of the withdrawals (read it can make people irritable/angry) so we worked through it. However, three and a half weeks later, she is still incredibly quick to get defensive/angry and shutdown (not like she ever has before). Shes been very closed off (not engaged emotionally) and hypersensitive to questions or jokes, making communicating with her an  -provoking task.   We work through each situation, and it almost always ends (after quite some time) with her showing herself as I know her: open, calm, loving, joking, etc. My wife explains that in those moments, she doesnt see me as I am. Specifically, she sees me as someone trying to hurt her by either blaming her/putting her down/trying to change her. No matter how calm and clear I am, her emotions jump to intense conclusions that they never have before (not nearly to this extent, anyways). My wife feels awful afterwards, and tells me through tears that Im not doing anything wrong. She says shes so sorry for how things are playing out and and doesnt know why they are. In her words, she doesnt feel like herself in those moments, and shes looking for me to hurt her, even though I never have. Basically, things go like this:   1) Harmless question/joke/conversation that she perceives as a threat 2) She reacts defensively or angrily towards me as a result 3) I react hurt/upset at hurt at her mean comment or hostile emotion 4) My reaction triggers her further until things boil over and she kinda ""loses it"" (has no attachment to reality/who I am) and acts very irrationally 5) It usually ends when I recognize how panicked she is (for example, she pushed me away when I tried to hug her because she thought I was going to hurt her) and I try to show her its safe  The only thing that seems to calm the situation or keep it from happening is if I notice her shutting down/getting nervous and show her overwhelming positivity and love. Ive gotten better at this over the few weeks but still make mistakes (especially since it can happen moment to moment). Even then, it can take awhile for her to rebound, and she avoids talking about it.   Now my wife has suffered a lot of emotional trauma at the hands of family members, significant others, and others that I wont go into detail about. I also communicated poorly due to my own   for awhile at the beginning of our relationship that caused some misinterpretations. However, weve worked through most, if not all of it, together and were the happiest and healthiest that wed ever been when we stopped edibles (we also felt great before we started). These were her feelings when we stopped, as well. She says she feels like she regressed completely, while also being far more reactive (angry/defensive/sensitive) than shes ever been before. She says she feels crazy.  Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? Is this simply an effect of the withdrawal that will pass? Did stopping cause some sort of unresolved trauma to surface (or PTSD/CPTSD)? I would greatly appreciate any insight, as Im trying to figure this out as I go. It truly is significantly different than it ever was before.  I really feel terrible about her being so worried about being hurt and feeling crazy. Were going to make an appointment with a psychologist to see if we can get some clarity and some tools to work through it more effectively. I just want her to feel safe again.

848,VastPause,1.0,I used to like things,"Ive had a long history of mild panic attacks which I never knew were panic attacks because I was too young or uninformed to realize what they were. Coupled with syncope I just assumed it was me trying to just keep my shit together to keep from passing out. Besides these occasionally triggered moments of borderline panic, I had no   otherwise. I could do anything. 6 hour solo road trips, solo hiking trips in remote locations, crazy roller coasters, power through emotional situations, car breakdowns in rush hour traffic, I wasnt afraid of anything.  Then I turned 30. I suspect my predisposition to panic attacks plus being in a relationship with someone who had   and panic attacks himself and had terrible public outbursts that stressed me out on a regular basis culminated into me to have a full blown panic attack (outside of getting too high in college or something) one day while driving down the highway. Out of nowhere. It was a simple thing. I just thought to myself, ""What if I had a panic attack right now?"" Cue pulling off onto an emergency call area and calling an ambulance that took me to the hospital.   Im 33 now and I havent been the same since then. Im almost always worried Ill have a panic attack if Im not 100% comfortable or safe in any given situation and on most days I cant drive without feeling anxious about traffic congestion or unfamiliar routes.   And Im not sure if its just normal aging out of some interests or being more conscious of my spending and saving as an adult but-   I recently moved into a new place and while cleaning out my stuff I was surprised at the sheer amount of *things* I had because I used to like these things.

Ive gone clothes shopping only a handful of times in that time, and mostly because my mom insisted on taking me shopping or because I needed new clothes for work. I used to love jewelry, and I still do like them, but I have no large interest in accessorizing the way I used to anymore.

I still socialize, maybe not at the levels I used to when I was younger, and my day to day life minus the situational   seems relatively normal. I still get out of bed without any issues and sleep okay. Im not particularly sad but I do notice I dont laugh the way I used to and in general things just dont tickle me the way they did.   So I dont know. My GP has me on clonazepam as needed for the panic attacks and just recently gave me a prescription for Zoloft that Im debating whether or not I should start.

Story: I already have my full license from my home country and 6 years experience in driving.  I’d say I’m a pretty good driver. I just get very anxious in situations where I need to be “judged”. I recently moved to a different country and unfortunately have to take my drivers test again to get a license here.   The night before my test I was so worried and felt sick to my stomach. This is normal for me, I get a very bad stomach aches whenever I have to do something I’m nervous about. I had also read reviews on the drivers centre. A lot of people mentioned a nasty female examiner who had a horrible attitude and failed people for no good reason. So I already imagined getting her and in my head I was going through all the things that might go wrong.  I told my husband and he said “The people writing those reviews probably don’t want to admit they didn’t drive so great. You will be fine, you’re a great driver!”. This put me at ease a little bit.  Fast forward to the moment of my test. I’m waiting in the car for the examiner to come over and, lo and behold, a lady came up with an attitude that instantly made my axiety go through the roof. She didn’t look at me, spoke like a robot and seemed incredibly fed up with her job. She did nothing to make me feel at ease.  On top of that she got really annoyed with me when I asked her to repeat herself when I didn’t understand one of her directions. I wanted to puke. I felt so small for the rest of the ride. I also noticed that whenever I was checking my blind spots, she wasn’t even looking at me. She kept staring out the window and adjusting her seat. I just wanted the drive to be over so bad.  The drive itself in my opinion went good, despite the examiners attitude.  But she didn’t seem to think so. At the end she told me I failed because I didn’t check my blind spots once. Which was completely false, but I was so taken aback that I didn’t know what to say.  When she left the car I just sobbed and called my husband to pick me back up.   I’m now terrified to take my test again and the thought of it just makes me panic and feel sick. I don’t really know what to do.

853,cool___guy,1.0,Too many drugs at once?,"Hello, redditors.  Long story short, Ive been dealing with mild depression for a few months, self harm (rarely) and, obviously, general   for a loooong time. I went to see a psychiatrist (covered by insurance) around 3 weeks ago and he prescribed me 4 drugs:   Alprazolam (0.5mg - generic) - 1/2 pill at 9am, 1/2 pill at 14pm and 1 whole pill at 22pm  Sertraline (50mg - generic) - 1 pill at 9am with milk (I drink it with kefir along Alprazolam)  Clonazepam (2.5mg/ml - generic) - 8 drops (0.8mg ingested according to the bottle)  Clonazepam (0.25mg - original) - 1 pill sublingual up until ten times a day, ONLY if strictly necessary  A few notes, I most certainly DID NOT like that psychiatrist at all. For instance, he commented on how ""dumb"" he considered for someone to self harm. To be honest, I dont believe that is something to say in front of a vulnerable person, which is pretty much every patient. Fortunately, I was feeling very analytical that day and shrugged it off, but this event tarnished his credentials. Overall, I tried to be practical: antidepressants are considered unpredictable  when it comes to the effects, as it depends largely on the persons organism; I had to start somewhere and it was urgent. Moreover, I needed his recommendation for a therapist (also insurance covered) which is really the long term treatment I desire. I should mention that I specifically told him to start low no matter what he was planning. A product of a dosage makes the poison mindset + red flag from his behavior...  Day 1 - Sertraline gave me nausea (thankfully, didnt have it anymore after that) and alprazolam made me drowsy.   controlled.  Day 2-9ish - Alprazolam still makes me sleepy. I once attempted drinking two cups of coffee too counter balance it to no avail.   controlled. I think clonazepam was interfering with my sleep quality, despite sleeping around 7-8 hours.  Day 10-14 (today) - Suicidal thoughts, depression worsening, low energy and major disinterest towards anything. I was kind of totally hoping for the thrill of Sertraline to magically kick in since the psychiatrist told me it takes at least 14 days.   controlled to some extent, a few emotional triggers still makes me irritable.   Note: Had a breakdown 3 days ago on my birthday. Cried and cried.  Note 2: I dont follow the hour schedule as I should, but I give a space of at least 5 hours between doses.  All in all, I would be very grateful if someone who has been on antidepressants or had experience on that matter could give me an insight if his ""recipe"" was too much to start off. Does my symptoms in the following weeks any way match the reasonably normal pattern? Is my reckless scheduling the main culprit?  I was adamant on sticking with it for at least one month and Im scheduled for a check up next week, but since these last symptoms appeared, I cant help feeling scared.

Its long, sorry. I tried editing it as much as I could but I felt like I needed to explain the context. Tl;dr at bottom.  I posted homemade food on a niche sub and woke up to &gt;1k upvotes, very high upvote ratio, and 20 comments telling me about how I called the food the wrong thing. Most comments were very polite. It was a reasonable thing to tell me, because it was food from a different culture than me, and I had mistakenly assumed that the fundamental ingredient of the dish and the ingredient that I used were the same.  But it was the few snide remarks that got me. How their partner was offended by this, or a grandma cries every time someone calls this \[food name\], or insinuating that I spent no time or thought on it. In reality, it took me 2-3 hours to make, but suddenly I felt like I was on the same level as people who cant cook, have no sense of respect for cultural food, and bastardize it. Later I realized that one commenter had misunderstood part of my post, assuming that I simplified the dish 8x more than I actually did. But even though I realized a small part of it was miscommunication, I still felt like it was my fault for not being clear.  I feel so ignorant, thoughtless, embarrassed, offensive, and just really really frustrated at myself for allowing this to happen. I have problems with disordered eating too, which made it worse. In a rare moment, it was a meal that made me feel almost normal. Instead, Ive been consumed with shame ever since I got negative feedback on it.  Its been days, but would I be stupid to delete this post now? Even though its karma and upvote ratio were so high, that just makes it even more visible.

One of the reasons, I, personally, have been upset with W and P has been because of these exchanges that I have had with them, both of which resulted in me raising my voice at each of them, but in those situations, I also felt the need to be defensive as I felt like I was being attacked and/or invalidated. However, W and P see it as them giving me criticism, and me not being able to handle it, which is why I ""lashed out"" rather than me being ""attacked."" In fact, P even made a comment on how ""similar"" these two exchanges sound, as if saying Im just making everything up. I accused W and P of trying to get info out of me (politics in our club), and P was so insulted by that and told me to reconsider our relationship. The only reason I accused W and P of that is because given the ""timeline"" of events from when I felt they were being more distant and unwelcoming was after I refused to give them the info they wanted -- BUT apparently, they never wanted the info, it was only for my safety they wanted it because I seemed concerned about it. When I talked to P about all of this, P said they had ""no problems"" with me, and I was the one with the problem, so they were willing to listen to me. But, P has told me that they wont apologize for what they did because they dont think they did anything wrong, but they apologize for how I felt.      Now, I dont know what to think. I want to validate my feelings because... I literally spent weeks crying and cutting, two things I never do because I was so confused and hurt by the way they were treating me. But, apparently, there was never a problem, it was all in my head, and it was just me blowing things out of proportion. So, now Im continuing to cry and cut because.... so, apparently, this is all a result of my own  /overthinking? I can barely face W and P now because... what if they are right? This is all my fault and it is my fault for the all the lost time spent with me distancing myself from them because I felt unwelcome. The fact that P, especially, has been so quick to jump back into our relationship as if nothing happened is more bothersome than anything. And, now it makes ME feel like I am doing something wrong because I am still fixating on this. But, how can I not? I was miserable, I didnt even have W and P as a support system because I thought they hated me, like... Im almost insulted they think all of this is just an overreaction from my head. But, what if they are right?      Literally, I just want to kill myself. In their defense, W and P have been making extra efforts to be nice to me (which is kinda annoying but Ill take it), and P has been acting super normal. Every time I interact with P now, it feels like old times, but.. I am STILL upset. And, when I did confront P about this, they were all ""happy"" and ""jokey"" which is great, but it also made it harder to, well, talk about everything. I just dont know what to do, but now that I think its my fault... I just want to kill myself. But, at the same time, I feel like Im being gaslit because... again, how do my complaints about them turn into ME being in the wrong?",1553994778,1553994780,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b7ibm6/gaslighting/,False,False,0.0

Probably for about 6 years at least. Since before I met him. I opened up to him a lot more than I had anyone else ever. And he has still been supportive after we broke up, even if I am often a mess. I’ve thought for a while that’s it’s probably not that healthy and that I’ll stop relying on him so much. Then I have a full blown panic attack and feel no control over contacting him.   He’s started dating again. I am happy for him, I really am. He’s not had the best time and it’s good that he’s turning things around. It’s good he’s more happy. But it means he’s not around so much. And I feel guilty contacting him because I’m not his girlfriend anymore. Someone else is. He still tells me I can contact him any time I need but It’s like I know my support is on a tenuous string and could disappear any moment.  This week has been a really rough one. I won’t go into details but something very small happened and it made me feel very upset, and I realised I couldn’t do it any more, that I by staying friends I was holding onto all the hurt that I had felt from breaking up. I hadn’t given myself any space or time to heal.   So, it felt kind of unnecessary and late to do it, but I sent him a message saying everything I should have said then. I wasn’t angry, just honest. I told him I’d miss him. But that I needed  to sort myself out, and I couldn’t do that with him there.   I don’t think it will have a very big impact on him.

Ive had to do 99% of the work in my friendships, even though they give heartfelt responses and were always great to me when I lived near them. I recently started talking to friends much more frequently, and I fear they see me as a nuisance. I was always discouraged/ controlled by my dad. My parents rarely encouraged me or told me ""good job"".  Im so scared that I will fail hairdresser school. Its my dream day job that I never told my mom/dad about because I was scared. The rent on my apartment was raised 60$ for this lease, and I fear those raises wont end. I love where I live. I cant seem to hold a ltr with any guy. I think I accidentally caused a friend an inconvenience.  If I kill myself, I have some notes planned, and I plan on post a smiling selfie so my family can have a positive memory &amp; closure.  I blame myself for everything. I am so grateful to my family. I dont want to die, but I think it would be best if I wasnt alive anymore.

922,m_eye_nd,1.0,Anyone tried propanalol?,"Disclosure; Brief mention of suicide attempt. If you don’t want to read anything bad about this medication do not continue reading any further. Thank you.   I (f23) have had   since I was around 15. It’s the bane of my existence. It’s generally and socially. Basically, I’m scared of everything from death, people, going outside, to my own thoughts. Anyways. I’ve always been a bit against taking pharmaceuticals. There are so many side effects and what not it’s always given me more   to think about taking them than to not. Eventually, after a few crappy events I went to the doctor and just said “look I’m really not coping, I have a fear of taking meds, is there something that’s not potentially addictive, isn’t dangerous and doesn’t have many side effects”. He prescribed me 10mg propanalol.   I’ve been taking them for quite a while now several months, maybe even a year? My memory is always hazy so I’m unsure. They do help. Just having them in my bag or in reaching distance makes me feel a little more relaxed. I take one before a social situation; family meeting, date, presentations when I was at uni etc - and they just calm me. Ugly thoughts are still there, but I’m not stuttering, shaking and my heart isn’t beating out my chest (as much).   I can supposedly take 1-3 a day as and when needed. I tried at first taking 3 a day, spreading it out. This just made me EXTREMELY tired ALL the time. So I cut them down to taking one a day. Then I just started to take them when I feel I need to. Like if I’m staying in the house all day then there’s not much need to unless people are coming over. I would say though, that I do take them frequently.   I haven’t noticed any side effects. Since the doctor made me think they were the safest I avoided looking at the side effects. I didn’t want to freak me out and ruminate about them. The only thing I do get is around my left breast, heart, arm and side of my chest, I sometimes experience an uncomfortable feeling. It doesn’t tend to hurt most of the time. It just feels weird and I have the urge to always put my right arm underneath my armpit as if I’m supporting that side of my body. It makes me feel a bit more comforted I don’t know why. I’ve had about 5 ECGs and all have been apparently fine. I can’t necessarily put this down to the propanalol as I think I have experienced this before I started them. I’m not entirely sure. But when I don’t take propanalol it’s not as prominent.   I’m not sure if I should mention, but I was in an extremely abuse relationship. I felt suicidal and washed a whole pack down with some alcohol at one point. I forced it back up not long after. Got really droopy and tired and passed out. Woke up fine. They didn’t have a bad effect on me even from doing that. But ...I did throw them up. Not sure how long exactly after.    However, my issue is - I accidentally came across and article about how propanalol has killed a second young girl and there are petitions and campaigns against it being prescribed. Now I have psyched myself out about it. If I carry on taking it, it will have the opposite effect and make me anxious I’m going to die. So it’s of no use now, I’m annoyed at my doctor, I don’t trust to take anything else and so now I feel stuck. I meditate, eat well, exercise, restating therapy soon - but STILL this isn’t enough! I hate that   is such a loophole of paradoxes! ",1553978806,1553978808,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b7ftdp/anyone_tried_propanalol/,False,False,0.0

(Note: Sorry I don’t have links and sources for everything. These are just some generalized facts I researched for my personal   and didn’t originally plan to share.) Hopefully it can help some of you:  * **We are *NOT* out of time as long as we keep working towards a solution *NOW***  * Seriously, if you don’t read any more of this know we have literal decades to combat these problems – your kids and grandkids won’t be fighting in the Thunderdome just yet  * Every positive change we make today moves those dire deadlines farther out and turns those decades into centuries  * **We have already improved so much in a short amount of time**  * Remember the hole in the ozone layer? It’s shrinking! That’s because of the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol back in the 1980s! Look what happens when we work together!  * Renewable power sources are becoming more affordable and common  * There’s more awareness on environmental issues and knowing is half the battle  * **Young people are involved in the fight – that is HUGE**  * Did you know Millennials are replacing Baby Boomers as the largest voting bloc? Millennials (and Gen Z) care about the environment and vote to protect it!  * A single kid in Europe (Greta Thunberg) can start a trend like school strikes/Fridays for Future and through social media reach all over the world – over 1.5 million youth have participated so far, and they’ve been endorsed by scientists and politicians  * Awareness alone is huge, as kids are holding one another responsible for the future – being eco-friendly is cool  * Children can change the minds of their parents and influence how they vote for the future  * **Politicians and corporations are starting to catch up**  * Green initiatives are becoming profitable – that means major corporations are going to go green to make green  * Politicians see environmental causes as a “safe” platform that appeals to both sides of the aisle  * More young politicians (as in new to politics, though some are young too) are seeing the environment as a main issue to focus on  * Public opinion matters to these people – as does money. Contact your representatives about voting on environmental issues. Tell stores you’ll shop elsewhere until they adopt green practices. Vote with your wallet. Spread the word.  * State and city level green initiatives are popping up all over the US  * **There is a global response to saving the planet**  * The United Nations has acknowledged this as an issue all nations should be working to fix  * UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement are all international efforts to help the planet  * The UN is hosting a climate summit in September of this year (2019 for you time travelers) to further address the issue  * Developing nations get a head start with greener technology and sustainable development  * Eco-tourism means major money in international locations too  * Other countries are also leading the way – China is leading on renewable energy, Canada is big on fighting climate change, and so on  * **Small changes in your local community can spread**  * Think of #trashtag – started with one social media post and has spread worldwide – start your own!  * Your city/town can test new environmental solutions before spreading elsewhere; New York just banned plastic bags, maybe your town can too  * Participate in your local government to see if you can start a positive change – maybe a simple cleanup initiative, maybe something bigger  * **Eco-friendly lifestyle changes are on the rise**  * Veganism and vegetarianism diets are easier than ever, it’s better for the environment, and people are adopting the lifestyle in droves. If you don’t want to completely cut out meat, see if you can handle #MeatlessMondays.  * Electric and hybrid cars are more affordable and reliable than ever  * Appliances with Energy Star ratings use less energy and are more efficient  * Rideshare programs are helping to cut down on emissions from commutes, as are work-from-home jobs  * More farmers’ markets are popping up with crops from local farms  * People are embracing reusable materials over single-use options, i.e. stores no longer providing plastic bags, restaurants removing plastic straws  * As mentioned above, being green is now cool  * **Science and technology are improving at a rapid pace**  * Better understanding of the issues we’re facing means scientists can come up with better solutions – support them!  * Could a scientist in the next year make a viable, large scale CO2 scrubber that solves this problem 100% overnight? Maybe. Is a marine biologist about to perfect artificial reef creation tomorrow? Maybe. Could we finally use garbage to power our cars as was promised in Back to the Future? Maybe.  * A lot of people way smarter than me are working on making the world better. Let’s see what they can do.  TL; DR: Reduce your eco-  with eco-actions. Go for a walk outside and collect trash as you go. Vote for environmental causes and politicians. See if your community has a green commission (you may be surprised) or start one.

Our first date we went to a pizza restaurant. I really didnt think about my   before the first date because I was so nervous about meeting her. (We starting talking through Bumble) After I met her and we sat down I felt fine. We ordered our food, it arrived, and when I took one bite and it all came back. I barely manged to eat two small slices and she only ate two slices. I imagine she only ate two because I only ate two. We had a good time and split the left overs at the end. I came home starving and ate my whole half of the pizza in one sitting. Now tonight we are going on our second date. We agreed to a dinner and a movie. I tried to offer up date ideas that didnt involve eating but she didnt seem to interested in those and I admit they were kind of stupid. So now I have to go out to eat again tonight. I also havent been to movie theater in two years. Last time I went it was fine, but now Im worried Ill have some   attack while watching the movie because I hate sitting in one place for a long time.

I regularly attend therapy, go to the grocery store, run errands and it is absolutely horrible. Im on the highest dose of   medication that I can take without being completely zombified and bed ridden all day. I already sleep twelve hours a day and am compl lethargic because of it. I have nervous tics, depression, schizophrenia, BPD, severe PTSD, and severe  , along with many other issues. These are all amplified when I have to leave my house at anytime. I get so nervous that I involuntarily twitch, cringe, and flinch. Store workers follow me around like they think Im going to steal and Ive even been called a crack head by a manager because of my nervous twitches. Its absolutely excruciating and unbearable to have to deal with this anytime I go out.   I cant control it and everyone treats me like Im less than or a horrible person because of it. Im sick of people making gross assumptions that Im on drugs. My   makes it impossible to eat most of the time, so people comment on my weight. I have to deal with vivid voices everyday telling me to kill myself, telling me that Im a horrible person, that all I do is cause pain, and causing guilt that makes me break down and cry. I broke down crying at the bus stop the other day because of it and all that did was draw more attention from the security gaurd thats always very attentive towards me (not in a good way). The combination of these issues makes me very frantic and erratic, though I try my best to suppress it and appear composed. Im not getting any credit for trying or being high functioning despite how draining everyday is.   People tell me Im making excuses, that I dont want to get better. They minimize my feelings. Im not allowed to be ill, I swear. Its like people are tired of the situation because they tell me that its gotten old. ""Instead of venting, why dont you do something to change your circumstances? Stop bitching and get a job.""  I go to social rehabilitation groups (which is extremely hard for me), I run errands by myself. I cant keep a job because I break down crying randomly throughout the day due to flashbacks. Im doing everything in my power with no empathy or sympathy from others. My ex is the only one I can count on and I hate being co dependent on him. I love him and he loves me but even he has used my mental illness against me out of anger/ frustration. Im super lucky hes still in my life, after everything weve done to each other but hes moving out of state very soon and Ill be completely alone. I hate burdening him because it takes a toll. My mom says that I dont have any of the issues Ive been diagnosed with, even though I have three confirmation diagnosis from three different psychiatrists/ therapists.

Every year, new trauma has accumulated because of my emotionally abusive, narcissistic mom and because of things that happened between my ex and I. I feel like its a never ending hurricane wave, knocking me down every time I try to get up. New trauma accumulated and built up back to back incessantly. Ive tried mindfulness, tried counting down from one hundred, tried indentifying three green items, tried breathing, tried meditation. The   is so intense I can barely focus on coping mechanisms. I feel like Ripley from Alien, when shes trying to say ""Youre my lucky star"" over and over again, while shes trapped in the ship with the xenomorph. I hate feeling beyond help.

The other days I power through and distract myself, but I never go back to my ACTUAL normal, even-keeled, content self.  I was injured in the face by a doctor and when I tried getting help to fix the issue with another doctor, it backfired and made it worse. This process took place over a matter of years - years of uncertainty, stress, self-consciousness, invasive treatments on my face, and feeling not whole.   My therapist does not understand the depth of this experiences impact on me; she has alluded to it not being ""real trauma"" because my life wasnt at stake. She encourages me to move forward - not to focus on it so much.   It is a hugely violating experience to have your face cut into multiple times and to trust two different doctors to know whats best, only to be stunned by the bad outcome each time. It is upsetting and continually traumatizing to look at your reflection and be reminded of the experience every time. This isnt an injury to my foot or the back of my arm - this is MY FACE. It matters. I dont feel at home in my FACE anymore. Worse, I lost trust in other people and in my own decision-making.  I dont know what else I can do. I feel like Im being gaslit by medical professionals. Its easier for them to think Im fine and ""time heals all wounds"" and I just need to relax, etc., than to admit that well-intentioned doctors can commit acts that truly destroy a healthy patients wellbeing. They think because Im high-achieving and come across calm and in-control, I will be fine. Its not true.

977,OutsideHour,1.0,Having way too much anxiety over my loved ones' safety,"(Apologies for spelling and formatting, Im on mobile and still shaking a lot, blah blah...)  I tried looking for people dealing with this on google but either I didnt articulate it well enough or it just hadnt been talked about.  So does anyone else really struggle with worrying about their loved ones safety?  Because I will have full on panic attacks if my partner doesnt text me after I expect him to arrive somewhere, or if I try to message him and the message doesnt deliver - even if I reasonably know that he didnt disappear or get hurt during a ten minute drive!   I basically have no clue how to deal with this, I sort of just try to cope with the panic until I get the little ""ding!"" message sound and I immediately feel like a complete idiot for worrying.  I use my partner as an example because Im in that scenario right now.  He was headed to a place with no coverage, I cant expect to hear from him for a couple hours at the soonest (six or seven at the lastest).  Usually (the couple other times hes gone) he would text before heading in, but I guess things were rushed today and he wasnt able to let me know he arrived safe.    Aside from him I also get this way about my sister, and I used to be the same about not being able to reach my parents (""oh, theyre ten minutes late coming home and my call went to voicemail?  Time to begin my life as an orphan..."").  I havent really been able to find any support for this worry, and Im afraid if I try to talk about it to people without   or anything, theyll think Im just clingy or controlling.  Its just hard to tell myself hes okay when its rare that he would fail to text me (he knows about my  ) and Im not really sure how to even begin talking myself down while I wait for an unknown amount of time before finding out that hes okay.  Thank you for any advice you can offer, or even just reassurance that Im not the only one who does this or that its gonna be okay.",1553946679,1553946681,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b7aeof/having_way_too_much_anxiety_over_my_loved_ones/,False,False,0.0

I’ve been on a ton of SSRI/SSNRI’s and I’m currently prescribed 20mg Viibryd (been on it for about a year now and so far it’s been good). I’ve experienced brain zaps a couple of times when weening off of other medications when I thought I was able to, mainly Effexor and Prozac were the ones I had trouble with brain zaps during withdrawal.  I quit smoking cigarettes over two years ago, but I’ve been consistently vaping during this time period. In the past week, I’ve lowered my nicotine levels from 6mg to 3mg, and I’ve started having sensations that feel exactly like brain zaps. Doing research has lead me mostly to dead ends, but I found one scientific article that said that in a lab rat test, rats given nicotine had significantly higher serotonin levels than the control rats. I’ve also found that brain zaps are mainly due to lowered serotonin levels in the brain after cessation of SSRI’s.  Does this mean I’m having brain zaps due to lowering my nicotine levels?

1002,cherrcherrcherry,1.0,I need help,"This is gonna be a long one, but I really appreciate if you would talk the time to read and tell me what I should do in some way. I dont even know what I want to ask or what kind of advice I need, but I just need help.  I am 15, but Im not trying to be an edgy person and self-diagnose/spread this out to the whole world for attention. I genuinely am having a hard time and its to a point where Im having suicidal thoughts.   With no exaggeration, every minute of every day I just have constant, nonstop worrying or awful fucking thoughts. I feel so alone and isolated, and I desperately have tried to change myself/appearance to make people like me and have admitted embarrassing shit to have someone notice. I realize thats going against what Ive said from not trying to be attention seeking, but sometimes my emotions get so out of control and I hit a low where Im like ""I need to know if anybody cares right now, I need to tell someone how Im feeling"". But nothing has worked.  I have been smoking cigarettes for the last 3 years, starting at age 13. At this point, my old friend and the 2 guys I mainly talk to now know, and even my mother. Shes not abusive and she does care a lot, and even though I was terrified of having her know, I had a little hope in me that this would tell her I needed help. Instead, now she lets me smoke with her, and its a joke now to my friends.   My body and face is also another huge issue. Ive been overweight and had negative thoughts about myself ever since I was really young, but its now have taken a toll. First off, the one friend I have is a guy that I met on the internet. Weve been talking for over a year and a half, and our relationship has evolved into this thing where we can act like a couple comfortably (but still being friends idk) and weve sent nudes. Thing is, I photoshop myself to appear smaller, and I always feel awful because he believes that Im a normal looking person, and I always imagine meeting for the first time and having him realize what I really look like.  Now, in real life, obviously I cant hide it. Over the years Ive had people constantly make comments like ""you dont need to eat that"", ""Im not fat like you"", or ""if you lost weight youd be pretty"". Even recently, I was invited to this sweet sixteen for the first time so I decided to wear a dress. However, my father told me I looked ""horrendous"" and that I needed to tie something around my waist. Being upset, I just said I would change but that lead him to flipping a table and getting angrier and telling me more awful things. This mainly happened because he was drunk and he sometimes freaks out (theres been worse times), and the shit he does just gets engraved into my head.  Then, I have my other guy friend. I really like him, I have since about 2 years ago when I met him, but its clear as bells that he doesnt like me as well and it hurts me a lot (Im aware I sound like another fetus trying to date a bunch of people bc it sounds cool but Im honestly not a dating-person myself. Its just sometimes you believe love or having someone care fixes all problems and its really hard to get out of that mindset).   Thing is, for him and to appeal to other people, I got rid of my glasses, dyed my hair, changed clothes, and started wearing makeup. When I came into highschool though, absolutely no one noticed this big change for me. Instead, I got made fun by him and other people. Its not bullying, and its meant to be seen as those weird harmless but roasting jokes ig, but it really hit me hard. And those jokes kept growing into my weight and my personality. And because I tried opening up about my emotions and shit Im dealing with, its just another joke of how whiny I am.   And now Im here. I cant talk or show anyone about anything without being made fun of or ignored. I feel like I was the type of person that could take a joke but just considering how sensitive and emotional I am with everything I just cant anymore. Its making me hate people and become bitter, and I hate that. But I also hate that no one takes me seriously or tries to help. Nobody wants to talk to me, Im alone at school, I hate myself with every fiber of my being, and my head just feels foggy and heavy with negative shit that never stops.  I have a lot, lot more to this story. Ive just tried to share the recent stuff, but so much has happened in my life and more within the recent years.   Im constantly worring about every fucking thing, and always upset. I know these experiences are relatively shared by everyone, but I mentally cant take it (I guess you could say Im a pussy).

1004,FMSTN,1.0,Tips for dealing with anxiety?,"First post on here but i feel like i needed a place to write some things down and see if i can get some feedback. So long story short i am 20 (M) and i dated a girl for about 4.5 years, from when i was 14 to 18, things ended poorly and i found myself creating scenarios in my head or i always had one of those gut feelings something was going wrong. In the end i found out she had been cheating on me for a month or so and i blamed myself for not listening to the thoughts or feelings i had. So about a month ago i started seeing this girl who is a year younger than me (19) and in the past i’ve had issues with getting too attached too quickly and getting hurt, so i told myself this wasn’t going to be the case this time but here we are, a month or so into things, and i have officially become attached and have a ton of feelings for her. She has been telling people that we are dating because she says she hasn’t felt this way towards someone in a while and quite frankly neither have i, (her ex’s in the past have been, well, not nice to put it lightly) and i want to date her and be with her because she makes me happy and brightens my day with her smile and she makes the negative thoughts i have about myself go away. Except her phone goes off constantly and it’s always other guys, so when i’m at work and she’s elsewhere i never know where she is and sometimes we don’t have communication as her phone was broken and shes currently using a crappy old phone that can only be used with wifi. So here i am, formulating scenarios in my head and thinking that the worst is going to happen, i’ve been having a tough time with life recently and have contemplated life itself multiple times and have tried hard to find a will to keep going, but then things like this happen and she keeps reassuring me that she’s focused on me and that she wants to be with me and i feel better for a little bit, but then my head goes to a dark space and i feel like i am always cornered and i feel alone. I really want things to work with her because as i said, she makes me very happy and i have developed some pretty serious feelings for her in a short period of time, so i came to reddit to write this out so i could get some things off my chest and to see if, first of all anybody would read this far, and second, to see if any of you could give some advice on how to manage this kind of thing.  Side note, she has voiced concern over this matter as well, saying she thinks i have an   disorder and that’s why i am constantly creating scenarios in my head and then apologizing for things that never even crossed someone else’s mind. She believes i should go to a doctor and have myself tested for this and that that might help me. (She has had a very rough past and been through a lot of traumatic events in her short life so far, so she is also on some meds to help with ptsd, bipolar disorder and some others as well.)",1553923856,1553923856,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b77lwx/tips_for_dealing_with_anxiety/,False,False,0.0

Anyway, he decided he was going to go to the bar tonight with a few friends. This is the first time he’s done this without me, and I was super anxious. It made me even more anxious that he took an Uber there, meaning he was planning on getting drunk tonight. Which has never been his intention before, since getting sober.

1014,DJBlok,1.0,I think i had a panic attack today.,"Today was supposed to be a day of rest for me. For the last month, Ive been going to college full-time while working two jobs. I havent had a day in the last month where I wasnt either in school or at work, so when I found out last week that I wasnt scheduled for either job today, I planned to skip the only class I had and just spend the day resting.  Unfortunately, that went all to shit today. Stopped off quickly at work to find out what my schedule was next week, but as soon as I walked in, I felt a sense of...I dunno, dread? Like I just wanted to go home and crawl into bed and shut the world out. So I did just that!  Started feeling better later in the day, so I just sat on my couch on my laptop while playing some music from my tv. Just relaxing.  After a couple of hours, I suddenly got that feeling of dread again. Out of nowhere. I spent the next 5 minutes just staring at the tv until I suddenly snapped out of it for a second. Long enough to call my g/f. I started to try to talk to her about what was going on, but in the meantime, I still felt like I just...didnt want to move. I just concentrated on breathing. After a couple of minutes, she decided she needed to come over to help.  I started feeling better by the time she came over, but I was still scared. I wasnt sure what was happening, but after looking things up, I think I might have had a panic attack. I thought about going to the hospital, but panic attacks arent actually physically harmful, they just can feel like it.   But it still scared the shit out of me. Im still worried.

So I have this devoted religious neighbour who’s very naive about life and extremely sheltered who sorta lives in her own world where, from what I see, mental illnesses don’t exist. She’s one of the “can’t you just get over it...?” or “just look to God and everything will be fine” type of folk. It’s quite ironic how I’m living right next door to her in my apartment complex. Anyways, yesterday she approached me like “I’d like to see you out more.” Me being the doormat I am, obliged. Now I’m having hella  . I feel obliged to be out and interact more or I’ll fail her, then she’ll be up my butt about this and I guess disappointed.   I’ve tried explaining both my   and depression to her. But she doesn’t get it whatsoever. Supposedly it’s all in my head. I’ve been up all night overthinking what she said. My neighbour is naive as hell and doesn’t understand how   can absolutely bring the toughest hardcore punk to their knees at any given time. “Just don’t think about what’s bothering you” and all that stuff. Well, saying that stuff makes me feel even more crap about myself doesn’t it?  I had a scrap with her a few days ago  *gets a phone call* Me: Hello Her: Would you like to sign this card for an event...? It’s on Thursday Me: Ok, I’ll come over soon and sign it* Her: Thanks, bye. Me: Bye  (*I said ok. But that was to please her. I didn’t really want to but didn’t know how to express that without causing offence)  *knocks on her door* Me: Hello, I’m here to sign that card Her: Cool *random chitchat* Me: So what date is this event? I forgot Her: Saturday Me: Really? I thought you said Thursday ............... Her: You know. Sometimes I think you intentionally twist my words Me: *tries to keep my cool but ends up losing my shit* —  She’s very emotional and cries lots. Which I’m sure is genuine. I don’t know her life story, nor does she know mine. But her emotions sorta amplify the extent of which I’m guilt tripped.  Then I called mum to vent... mums like “you need to apologise” .....what? At least my grandparents understood when I vented to them. They can’t even relate as they’ve rarely ever experienced   in their lifetime - but they understand.  I’ve been up all night. I’m highly prone to manipulation. So of course I kind of guilt tripped myself into thinking that maybe I offended her. Maybe I done something wrong?  So on and so on. It’s not just me who has a dislike for her, other tenants living in my apartment complex too. I’m trying my best to not bash on her, I’m sure this post will come off that way, but she just doesn’t understand mental illnesses.  On another occasion, she setup this dinner in the common room for everyone. Even-though a few people politely denied due to commitments like work, events,  . She still insisted everyone come as “it’ll be a happy time where we are all together interacting with our fellow neighbours.” Yeah, nah. I can’t just put my mental health on hold for any one event... it doesn’t work like that. Kinda like Christmas last year where I got extremely stressed and withdrew myself.

However today, I have felt random bouts of cold air around me but I am in a house so that might be the case. I also had some tingling around my body, but that could be due to my dry skin as I have not put lotion on it for a few days.

1024,whispersanddaydreams,1.0,The Rusty Old Train.,"Ive been clamped up for quite a while now and I thought Id write a story relating to my anxieties. Frankly, I think its helped me articulate my thoughts, though in a narrative. In a way, its also helped me analyze and accept my feelings. Please let me know if this is okay.  --------  ""Youre a bit lost, arent you?"" the rusty old train asked the confused lady standing alone by the station.  ""Im not sure,"" the lady replied with a sad tone in her voice.   ""Let me help you,"" the old train chuckled as the doors creaked until it fully opened, though it took quite a while.  As the bumpy tracks guided them, the old train gave her glimpses of the beautiful view outside its windows. The scenic rivers, the flowery gardens, the lush forests.  ""I think I know this route,"" the lady told the old train.  ""You do indeed, little miss. Youve been passing through this route before - maybe you just havent had the time to appreciate these things recently?""   The girl smiled as she realized what the old trains point was. ""I like you. Would you mind if I stick around so we could talk more?""  ""Of course not. Just dont forget to smile, and you have yourself a deal,"" the old train proposed.   The tracks were still as bumpy as they were, but the journey for some reason was smoother. Its wheels didnt mind the rocks, its engine had more vigor, and the steam coming off its vents were hotter than ever.  The outside breeze was freezing, but the old train made sure that its interiors were warm for the lady who now had a beaming smile as she childishly looked out the window.  ""Thank you for helping me remember, old train. Can I pay you back by keeping you company?"" the girl asked.   ""You dont have to, young lady, but Id greatly appreciate that,"" the old train responded with a hint of anxiousness in his voice. The happy lady didnt seem to notice it, being too busy with the view. The old train was happy - he felt that, once again, he had purpose ane that he could still be admired despite his creaks and dents.  The journey, naturally, had to take a stop.  ""Where are we?"" the lady asked.  ""Its the Central Station, little miss. Its a busy station filled with lots of things that would keep one busy for decades,"" the old train exaggerated.  ""Would y... Would you like to roam around?"" the old train hesitated as he asked.  ""Is it okay? I promise Ill be back right away!"" the girl giddily asked as she looked out the window.  The old train saw the look on her face - far from the one she had when their journey started. Her smile went from ear to ear, and her eyes had a glow that wasnt there before.  ""When you look like that, how could I let you miss this chance?"" the old train replied as his doors opened - slowly, as its joints made high pitched creaks. The other people in the station covered their ears in pain, and the old train felt helplessly embarrassed as it could not do anything. The young lady just giggled, not seeming to care about the noise.  ""Are you embarrassed as well, coming off a rusty old train?"" the old train asked the lady, hoping for security. As long as she was there, the old train could not care less what anyone else thought.  A quiet moment passed, and it was just then when the old train noticed the young lady was already out. Assuring itself momentarily, the old train happily waited.  The old train was, after all, a train she adored and appreciated.  The lady spun in circles, overwhelmed by the things she missed when she was lost in thought, looking at all there was to see and experience.   The chiming of coins coming from inside the arcade.  The delicious smell of food from the stalls. The fun music from a small bar where people were drinking and laughing and socializing. The cute little shops selling trinkets and souvenirs. The gorgeous dresses displayed on storefronts.  The old train grew weary - worried about the young lady. Its old bell was broken and therefore couldnt ring, and the only option was to let out a loud whistle from its old steam engine.  ""What are you doing?"" the girl asked, seemingly a bit upset by the attention the old train caught. The other people were looking at the old train again - some were laughing at how ragged it was, and some were annoyed by how loud the whistle was.  ""Its about time we left the station,"" the old train replied and noticed her tone has changed, and so the old train apologized for the noise.  ""Just a bit more, I promise. Im just having a bit of fun!"" the lady said with glee. The old train was glad to hear the joy in the young ladys voice, and told her to go have her fun.   Minutes passed and the young lady still wasnt in view. Embarrassed and all the while scared that the girl might be upset again, the old train opted not to use the steam whistle. The station was starting to be filled with other trains.  At that moment the old train noticed all the other trains that were in the station. Their whistles sounded nice. Sturdier wheels. Better engines.  Beautiful. Shiny. New.  The old train realized that it wasnt unique - all these other trains could do the same, or even better than it could. Nevertheless he waited for the young lady, not wanting to spoil her fun.   The old train was, after all, a train she adored and appreciated.  After hours of waiting, the old train was ordered by the station to leave. ""But Im still waiting for a young lady, she knows Im here,"" the old train insisted. After repeatedly being told to leave the old train became scared and anxious of what would happen to the lady if it had to leave.  In a fit of frustration, the old train let out a loud steam whistle. The old train knew the lady would be able to tell whose it was, and she would come back.  And so she did, but with disappointment and annoyance clearly visible on her face  ""Im sorry I had to do it again, but we have to leave. The platform has to be open for another train."" the old train tried to explain.  ""Come on, what do you say? Lets go on another journey! Let me show you the rivers, the forests, the gardens, and all those other things again!"" the old train offered, almost begging.  ""I thought you would trust me when I said I would come back,"" the lady said in a tone that seemed flat and unimpressed.  ""Oh I do, little miss. I really do! Its just that we have to go now, the station says so. How about it? Im sure youve had your fun! I cant wait to hear your stories. Come on!"" the old train tried not to sound desperate, as it tried to open its rusty old doors once again. The doors, as it slowly crawled its way to opening, made loud high pitched noises again.  ""You couldnt trust me, could you? You couldnt let me have this fun without having to doubt my word, "" the lady asked, her voice breaking as if she was about to cry.  The old train tried to open its doors just a bit faster. The creaks grew louder and now everyone, even the lady, had to cover her ears. The noise eventually became so loud that everyone had to cover their ears, and the lady fell down on her knees in pain.  ""Make it stop, please make it stop. It hurts my ears,"" the lady pleaded. The old train was stuck. The only way to make it stop, obviously, was to not open its doors..and if the doors didnt open, the lady wouldnt be able to go in.  At this point the old train noticed how pointless the whole act was becoming. All the people and all the other trains were focusing on it now. Disappointed. Annoyed. Disgusted.   ""Please.""  The lady begged for the pain to stop. The pain that the old train inflicted by being selfish, by not wanting to be left alone, by yearning to be admired and appreciated.  ""Please.""  The old train pleaded, wanting to hear the ladys stories as she sat in the warm interiors while they breezed through the tracks again.  It was too late to realize how desperate the act was, and there was nothing else to do to remedy the situation but to leave.  So the old train left the station and went on without the young lady. Its doors left halfway opened, letting the dirt and dust get inside, reminding the old train of the lady and how they got her through her confusion and sadness. But it was all there was to it. It was only natural for them to part ways.  The old train was, after all, nothing more than a rusty old train.

I also played in the jazz band a secondary instrument, and I sang in choir. I quit music after high school... I went on to getting my BA and Masters in completely different topics because I feared failing as a musician.

We have so much love for music, and it really brings us together... the problem is, I can’t play with my boyfriend.

I know it hurts him too because whenever I do allow myself to play around him he gets so hurt when I fall into this internal sob story about how inferior I am and quit playing around him for another long span of time.

Ill try to make it short..  Ive been together with my girlfriend for about 2 years, and believe me, it has been an emotional rollercoaster ride being on the sideline of someone struggling with different mental illnesses. Ive seen her in and out of therapy, on different meds with no results what so ever. Ive had to talk her out of killing herself on a couple occasions, drive her to health clinics in the middle of the night, because things were so bad I didnt knew how to handle it. She used to get next to none sleep at night, couldnt get out the door due to extreme  , but worst of all she wasnt in control of her own head. She used to hear voices telling her all kinds of bad stuff and she saw stuff as well. Mostly unpleasant faces, really dark stuff. She really was a wreck.   Now you might say that this is too far out, hocus-pocus-like for your liking. My girlfriend did as well and gave it a shot though being skeptical. She went to a clairvoyant, and this really made an instant impact. Like a HUGE impact. I wont go into what this person specifically did, because that would make this post unnecessarily long, which it already is, my apologies. Ill just say, that this person started out be asking what my girlfriend would like to achieve, to which she replied something like: ""gain control of her own thoughts and find peace"".  After one hour with this clairvoyant, her shoulders dropped 20 centimeters, she stopped shivering, her eyes went from ""Im frightened the fuck out"" to suddenly having a peaceful glow, she now has a lust for life, and has become able to do all the stuff she wasnt able to do before, while doing it with a smile of joy. All those negative thoughts, those voices and faces are gone. She now has the power of her head in her own hands. Shes a totally transformed person.   Im not saying this is for everyone, but after seeing how it has literally ""healed"" my girlfriend, I just had to tell you that it might be an option. So if you have the smallest interest in giving it a shot, please do. Because Ive seen my girlfriend do EVERYTHING therapists and psychologists tells you to do with no improvements, but this really fixed her up. I know it sounds too good to be true, but fact is shes now feeling 100 times better.  I hope all of you one day will be able to live the life you deserve.

1084,Puggage,1.0,Can you train your fight or flight response?,"Mine is triggered constantly, maybe a strange smell, a weird wind, a bad thought,  the temperature feels wrong. Or just a general feeling of unease causes it.  Im convinced that my comfort seeking behaviour through my life has caused this, to the point where I cannot distinguish between real threats and mild discomfort.  I was always kind of anxious and wary by nature, not debilitatingly so but it was my personality. In my late teens almost a decade ago had a full blown panic attack and that seemed to flip some kind of switch which brought the symptoms from mental to physical on a regular basis.   Basic human urges like thirst, hunger, tiredness, I can no longer identify. Instead I get the ""something is off"" sensation which will usually trigger severe  . I take medication so I dont have full blown panic attacks thankfully, but I still find it debilitating as really the only thing that seems to help is a nap (Resets the mechanism?)  and it tends to trigger many times each day. If I cannot leave the room and lie in a dark place it will just continue until its unbearable.   A strong sense of ""I am in danger"" and its such a visceral feeling that you cannot rationalise it away, its not part of the conscious thought process, so I dont think any amount of rationalisation helps which is where I have been going wrong. If I spent as many hours on any skill as I spent in this state Id be a master of that skill. Its such a waste of energy and that is what bothers me more than anything.  Im wasting my life in this state when Id rather be doing something productive. I have tried ignoring it and continuing doing what Im doing but it has already stolen my attention by that point, so anything that requires concentration is out of the window, as is any enjoyment of the task at hand.  I suppose my theory is that I spend my life in such comfort that I cannot tolerate even the smallest discomfort, its alien to me, and so the many discomforts that are a simple fact of life are able to trigger such a reaction as my instincts have no real threats as a comparison.  I dont exercise because its uncomfortable, and basically avoid anything else uncomfortable or that I dont like.  It feels like paradoxically the longer I spend in my comfort zone, the smaller my comfort zone gets, to the point where there is no comfort zone any more. (If Im not already there Im close)  Maybe I need to subject myself to discomfort in order to calibrate my fight or flight response? How so? Intense exercise? Cold showers? It sounds too simple but I think my brain literally does not understand the concept of danger due to the programming Ive given it, and feels the need to create its own from thin air.  It hasnt always been like this, so my theory is that if I can show it that no, THIS is discomfort, THIS is scary, THIS is a threat (in a controlled and safe way) then it might go some way to resetting my programming and recalibrate to realise that the day to day mild discomfort is no threat.  Is there anything to this or is it nonsense? It makes sense to me, but Im not a psychologist. It definitely seems like something that I have inadvertently trained myself to do over many many years, and since the brain is plastic, I dont see why it wouldnt be possible to recalibrate the threat response and do it in reverse (not that I imagine it would be an easy or pleasant process).

The theater is in a major city so there’s going to be a lot of people. I’d like to go as I’ve always appreciated and enjoyed watching broadway shows, but I can’t find a friend to go with last minute. I’m honestly debating going alone because of the high quality of the show/theater and I haven’t been to a play in what seems like forever. Problem is my nerves are getting to me and having SAD is not helping!  Does anyone have suggestions on what I can do to preoccupy myself/thoughts, if I attend?

1100,tiger_wsquared,1.0,Trying to move forward and just end up convincing myself why bother.,"Honestly Im not sure why Im writing this but it feels like somewhere inside my own head I need to say this out loud in some form or another to really make it real. I dunno but here goes I guess.     Ive been hit with the double whammy lately of both   and depression. Ive had   for years, Ive been better but lately Ive been a lot worse. Worse enough that depression took root in my mind making the world whole lot more monotone than before. I lost control of my life, I cant hold down a job, pushed away my closest friends and probably more things that I just cant even remember.     Then something happened, I ended up watching a show on Netflix that has been described as a real tearjerker. I thought why the hell not, what else could go wrong with me. Well I cried. I cried for the first time in i dont know how long. I wept, then I laughed at the fact I was weeping and I finally wept a little more. It was such a massive release for me that it lasted for several days. I didnt realise feeling so sad could feel so good.     In those days something awoken in me, my imagination came back like a tsunami (hit me like one too been having some crazy vivid dreams of late) and something I thought I had lost returned. An idea of mine for writing a book. A book, something that was always in the back of my mind but I always dismissed. I was always afraid of the judgement it would bring.      Even so, everyday this week Ive sat down for maybe an hour or two and just wrote. I wrote till my hand was sore. I ended up with nearly a hundred pages of notes, plots, character arcs, dialogue and plans. It was strange but I was feeling good for the first time in a long while. Its like Im actually doing something for once, that I was actually walking forward.     Then it happened, the voice. That voice of doubt that creeps in, makes us question every action and every thought - making us doubt everything with an unrelenting force. The voice telling me why bother, you will just give up on it like everything you do. Ive google searched more times than I care to admit on why I shouldnt write a book already, I couldnt help myself. I just wanted to do something in my life to get back on track, a goal in mind to help keep me pushing forward.     I honestly dont know if this book will become anything but I wanted to be the one to make that decision. Not that voice of doubt. Not this worry that Im wasting my time or that I shouldnt even bother. Not this fear that if I do this and fail, that I shouldve just given up beforehand to avoid the failure in the first place. Maybe this book isnt the solution I need but it could open up the path I do need. I just wish I could keep it going long enough to find out the answer to that question.      Sorry for this rant, I want to keep going with this project but its just difficult when you are the one stopping yourself from even trying. Thank you, I appreciate you reading this desperate rant of mine.

1101,MattgMac04,1.0,I had an emotional meltdown in Walmart,"I suffer from  , claustrophobia, and  , as well as depression, Ive been dealing with that for well over a month and a half. Ive suffered from depression before too. Last time it lasted for a little over a year. But that was a few years ago. I really dont like leaving my house very much, It can be overstimulating, I start to get nervous, and panic. But sometimes my parents make me go with them anyways, like today for example, my dad was going to run some errands, and made me and my siblings go with him, his car is kind small, so we had to try to squeeze into the car which already makes me really nervous and uncomfortable, today was a busy day, a lot of places were pretty crowded. I didnt get my medication this morning, because we ran out. So we had to go pick those up, by the time we managed to get my medication, it was already too late to take them, (Im supposed to take them in the morning, and it was about 12:30 by the time we got them because of the traffic.) And then my siblings were all bickering and arguing, and yelling at each other, I already had an awful headache, I could tell that I was starting to break, my temper was shortening, on top of the fact that I was still in a small car with all of my siblings, leaving almost no space I was already starting to fell nauseous,  and I was starting to get kinda fidgety. Then we arrived at Walmart, we went in and it was really crowded, my siblings still bickering, and with all of the people, it was really crowded, then I guess someone tried to steal something because the alarms by the doors went off. So the combination of the sound of My siblings now screaming at each other at this point, and the sound of the alarms, (we were still pretty close to the doors) and me feeling trapped in a small confined area just all caused me to snap, there were a million things going through my mind all at once, I couldnt control myself I started hyperventilating and panicking, I fell to the floor curled up and just started crying, I couldnt stop. My dad had to take me out of the store into a more open area until I calmed down. I feel embarrassed about it now. Because I, a 14 year old boy, who is supposed to be mature and have control over my actions, just fell over and started crying in Walmart. I feel like I might have made people uncomfortable. It also bothers me that there are people who remember me just because of this incident, even though they are people who I will never meet. I am so embarrassed about this, and I dont know what to do about it.",1553895890,1553895891,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b735cd/i_had_an_emotional_meltdown_in_walmart/,False,False,0.0

I have been on meds plenty of times over the years. As of the past 3 weeks my   has grown ten fold. I don’t want to leave the house, I don’t want to do anything. I start having panic attacks but I have 0 triggers. I literally couldn’t even tell you why I’m panicking or what the   is about. It’s got to the point now where I’m starting to feel like giving. Suicide has crossed my mind because I can’t keep living this way, though I have no plans nor do I believe I would follow through. I have an amazing supportive fiancé but I’m sure he’s fed up with my shit deep down. I feel like just giving up on my big goals. I feel like giving up on everything.   The part that is so difficult to understand is Im not sad about anything. I don’t feel “depressed” if that makes any sense. I don’t cry often, I don’t feel down or upset often. In recent years I have been through some difficult times, lost my mom, lost my job of 5 years, lost the only grandpa I have ever had. It’s just getting worse,   and panic I spend hours crying over these feelings of doom. This isn’t like me. I know I need to go see someone but Im just so ashamed that this is who I have become.

1106,im_the_real_hero1324,1.0,My experience with antidepressants,"Hello everyone. I wanted to make a post about my personal experience with the antidepressant Lexapro. To put it bluntly, its worked wonders. Ive noticed that theres a lot of negative stories about medication so I wanted to add my positive one. TLDR is at the bottom since this is way longer than I anticipated.      I want to give some history now. Ive had   for as long as I can remember. I remember when I was young and first starting my period I would wake up in the middle of the night and pace my room for hours in paranoid fear that I would make a mess. I remember checking and re-checking the corners of my room to make sure that there werent any spiders crawling around the walls. I would pace around my house wondering what the next terrible thing would happen. High school was when it got worse for me. There were moments where I would have panic attacks about every other day in the shower. I was a mess. This was all due to being emotionally abused growing up.      I started college and right and I got really into fitness. I started training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and to say that it changed my life is an understatement. I gained confidence and strength and self respect. I moved out of my parents house and officially started going to therapy at my university. Things slowly progressed from there and slowly but surely I was getting better. My life improved and my   was still there but I was meeting it head on with the intention to get better and not let it ruin my life anymore. Ive been going to therapy since my freshman year of college and its been a great help. Then about a year ago I got a concussion. I didnt lose consciousness but it was severe enough that the urgent care doctor sent me to the ER. The ER doctor monitored me for a moment then once he realized I wasnt in any immediate risk I was sent home. I took the next day off. My symptoms immediately were nausea, disorientation, drastic mood changes, and slurred speech. Basically, I felt severely drunk and my head hurt. For about 3 weeks afterward I couldnt hear any loud noises or it would cause a headache. I got better slowly. But I noticed something, my   was through the roof. I continued through therapy. To summarize, I got 3 more totaling it out at 4. Its been proven that concussions can bring   symptoms to the forefront and make them appear worse.     At this point, the beginning of 2018, I was an absolute mess. I was seeing a concussion specialist and she is absolutely amazing. My   was going through the roof. I was seeing my therapist. I felt like I had no hold of my emotions anymore and I would go into a deep spiral. I was absolutely miserable. One day during a therapist appointment he suggested that I get prescribed medication. Now I want to mention this, I didnt want this. I was beyond terrified. Its not that this was a completely new thought to me. I had on a few occasions thought about it but I didnt think I needed it. I was fine. Nonetheless, I made an appointment with a psychiatrist on campus to talk about my options. I wanted to see.      So in I go. Shes looked through my therapists notes and she asks me a couple questions. The first appointment she put a medical diagnosis to my problem. My   comes from having a hyperactive fight or flight response. Due to my abuse, this is how Im wired. Her theory and experience is that by putting me on medication I could retrain my brain to stop this harmful cycle. I clenched my teeth and sighed. This is absolutely not what I wanted to hear. I didnt want a pill to fix my problems. I wanted to fix my problems. I didnt want to become reliant on a medicine. I expressed all of this to her and I asked her my questions. She answered all of them honestly. She noticed how hesitant I was with this and she gave me an option. Lets try medication for 4 weeks and if I didnt like it, I could stop. I thought about it for a moment but then I agreed.      I got prescribed Zoloft. To summarize real quick, it was terrible. I went manic for a second there. I couldnt sit still. My mind was going a million miles an hour. I would be happy for one second and thought I could do anything but then the next I would be on the brink of a breakdown. My psychiatrist wanted me to stop since in her words ""this process didnt have to be difficult"" but I kept on going. It didnt work out for me and I got worse.      Then she prescribed me Lexapro. The first day I took it I noticed a difference. The terrible affects that I got from the Zoloft went away and I felt normal. In my head I was waiting for some terrible side affects to present themselves. They didnt. I upped my dosage slowly. Still nothing. The only side affects that I can tell are I sweat more now and my dreams are extremely vivid. Thats it. Ive been on it for about 5 months now and Im at 20mg once a day.     Now for the difference, I felt like I have an anchor again. Before, I felt that I was just a feathers touch away from going completely insane and spiraling into something terrible. Now, I feel that I have control of myself again. Its been amazing. Ive gone through a few highly emotional times and each one Ive handled like a champ. I knew that this feeling was temporary and that I would be okay. I still have   of course but its been greatly reduced. My sex drive hasnt been negatively affected. As a matter of fact, its increased. This was honestly my biggest worry. I didnt want a stale sex drive on top of my other problems. That was a big no in my book.      Im lucky that it only took me two tries to get the right medication. I trusted my doctor and now Im here. Better than before. Im not planning on staying on this forever and I dont believe that Im dependent on it. Now that Im in it I realize that medication is just one tool out of many. My other tools are therapy and physical exercise. Just medication wouldnt do the trick. Right now my goal is to learn how to deal with my problems in a healthy way and allow the medication to re-teach my brain what ""normal"" is. This is temporary and I know it.      Medication doesnt have to be hell. It doesnt have to dry you up like the Sahara desert. It doesnt have to be a source of  . Go to a trusted professional and they can and will help you find the right combination. Just because it works for me doesnt mean it can work for you. Everyone is different and theres so many medications that can help.      I hope this was useful to some people. Please ask any questions that you want. Ill be happy to answer.     TLDR; I got prescribed Lexapro and Im doing better. Nothing bad here. ",1553893761,1553893761,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b72qto/my_experience_with_antidepressants/,False,False,0.0

If I was given the choice between vomiting and death, I couldnt promise that I wouldnt choose death. It may not seem like a huge factor in my life, cause hey - people rarely throw up, right? But it effects me everyday. I wont eat/drink anything that 2-3 days BEFORE its expiration date, I tend to eat less food out of fear that I will overeat and throw it up, I take extra precautions to ensure that I dont get food poisoning or a stomach bug, and I have a hard time doing/seeing anything that may trigger my stomach. I probably sound crazy. And, yes - I know that my fear is dramatized more than it should be. But I honestly cant get over it. And unfortunately for me, Ive had MANY instances of throwing up. A few months ago I started birth control. I guess it was a really high dose and if I took one pill really close to the next (ex: one late at night &amp; one early in the morning) my stomach would have a reaction and I would throw up a few times. This happened about four times in one month. - side note: yes, i now know that i should take my pill at the same time everyday thanks - I just cant stomach (pun intended) the thought of a bad bacteria being inside of me, or throwing up actual contents that are in my stomach, and that horrible feeling you get where youre about to throw up. Its really all in my head but I dont think Ill ever be able to get over it. It even got to a point one time when I was throwing up and I told my boyfriend to call the ambulance. Of course, being in a sane state of mind, he didnt and tried to calm me down. But in that particular moment, I really felt like I was dying.

1122,GoodnessGrace-ish,1.0,How do I know if my anxiety is normal,"Ever since the birth of my first child 4 years ago, I have daily   about something happening to her or my husband or myself (or my son who was born 2 years ago).  Reading a horrible news story will always trigger it but so will TV shows where tragic fictional things happen - and it’s impossible to avoid.   A news headline about child abuse, a car accident, kidnapping.  I start to imagine my own children or husband in that situation, and it makes me physically ill, and it stays with me all day.    Recently a young lady was kidnapped, assaulted and robbed in a Chick Fil A restaurant at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon.  And in a “nice” town not far from me.  I don’t feel safe.  I live in a nice community but I don’t feel safe walking to the park with my kids, because ‘what if’ - if I take them to Target it the grocery I get anxious getting them into the car because what if someone comes up behind me and steals my car or has a gun and I cannot protect myself or my kids?

1128,Vulpixchick21,1.0,Need some advice for helping to support my anxious mother,"Hi there, some background to start with: Both myself (23F) and my mother (55F) are anxious people, but only my mom has been formally diagnosed with GAD. She takes anti-  and anti-depressant medication, goes to therapy regularly, and gets messages fairly often to help her deal with her disorder and stress from a busy job. She works from home most days, which is helpful to allow her more time to relax, but she is fairly overweight and doesnt exercise very often, despite my encouragement.  Growing up, it was hard having an anxious mother. Her constant fears and worries over everything rubbed off on me, and today I often have to limit my time talking to her because conversations inevitably turn to her ruminating over anxious thoughts. Sometimes it seems like shes too wrapped up in her own worries to really listen to me.  Dont get me wrong, my mom and I have a good relationship and we love each other, but I often find myself feeling frustrated with her behavior, mostly when it comes to exercising and being healthier. I think because of her   and her tendency to avoid difficult situations, she makes a lot of excuses as to why she didnt go for a walk or do some other physical activity that day. I try to encourage her to keep a regular workout routine whenever it comes up, but she ends up falling out of the routine and back into bad habits, like boredom eating and watching a lot of TV after work.  I worry about her (ironic, I know) because her doctor has informed her that she is pre-diabetic and really needs to lose a little weight in order to prevent the onset of the disease.  What are some things I can do to really get through to my mom and encourage her to exercise more? Should I text/call her about it, or maybe ask her to try some classes with me? Also in general, how can I be supportive and understanding of my moms   but also not condone her bad habits? She gets defensive if I try to gently tell her not to do stuff. Part of me completely gets how she feels since I tend to be anxious too, but I also feel like she could try harder to help herself.  Thanks to anyone to reads this, sorry its a bit long.  TL;DR: My mom is overweight but her   causes her to avoid exercising regularly. How can I help her stick to a routine and generally be supportive without condoning her avoidant behavior?",1553885713,1553885716,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b715u9/need_some_advice_for_helping_to_support_my/,False,False,0.0

I really don’t where to begin, way too many stories to tell, but the gist of it all is I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin. My mother was  extremely abusive, mentally, emotionally, and physically, then she died when I was 12.  She was 30 years old at the time of her death. My parents were married and had 3 children including myself. My father never stepped in to stop my mother, and when she died he turned to drugs and alcohol to cope.  I can remember always having this feeling of walking on eggshells in our house, my body was always rigid and tense, even when I tried to sleep at night, I was so terrified of my mom that she didn’t have to say a word to me, just here walking in to the same room as I would instantly cause me to tremble in fear. Now I’m in my 40s and I still have this anxious, nervous feeling that has never went away. I just want to be able to finally feel relaxed, I want to know what it’s like to just lay down for once and not be stiff as a board.  I don’t know if I’m posting in the right group, I don’t know where to begin, tears are already streaming as I’m typing this, just the thought of going down memory lane, makes me feel like I can’t breathe, as body tenses up even more.

So I go, we talk it out, he prescribes me low doses of effexor and valium.   I go home, tell myself they are there if I need them, but I dont want to take them since I have been doing well and   hasnt ever gotten out of control.   A few days later, I was coming up on the beginning of  a week that was the start of some serious test taking and project-finishing, so I said ""what the hell, Ill take the effexor, should ease the stress""  Two days in, everythings fine. 3rd day, its an easy, no stress day at home. Took effexsor without food. Half an hour later, BOOM full blown, first ever, panic attack. Called my moms nurse friend, who told me it sounded like a panic attack, that I would be fine, etc. She stayed on the phone until I calmed down an hour or so later. Roommate made me take the valium to chill my ass out (it did, I fell asleep shortly after).   Since then, I have had a few more attacks, all less in intensity. As of today, I havnt had one in over 3 weeks, though the past few nights Ive experienced some chest tightening, rapid heart beats and headaches before bed. I ignore it though, and can usually sleep.   I havnt completely stopped the effexor out of fear for it causing another attack. I have not taken another valium because I think it makes me feel like Im being ""panicky"" which makes it more real, when I dont want it to be.

Lead into small observation room with a two-way mirror looking into another room, empty except for a small chair and a large television.  A small child is lead into the room and set in the chair.  The television is turned on and a movie starts.  You ask what they are showing the child.  They answer that they are showing him clips of graphic violence and disturbing horror movies.  As the film progresses, the child is visibly agitated and upset by the images.  You ask what they are going to do once the film ends.  They reply that they will just continue to replay the film for the child, knowing each time will make his fear grow and continue to upset him always increasing his emotional distress.  You ask what the point of this experiment is.  They reply that there is no point.  They are not studying or observing anything.  They just want to keep watching the film, over and over.

1158,focusrunner79,1.0,System for getting rid of anxiety,"After years of trying to develop an optimal strategy for getting rid of  , I finally found out something that works. Here is what I have came up with.  So at its base level,   is something that occurs due to thinking. But its important to understand how and why   occurs when we think, even if our thoughts are meant to deter from our  . To start, it is very difficult to consciously control our thoughts. If you are an anxious person, it usually does not matter what you think,   will find its way in your head and there is no thought process that can stop this. The reason this is the case is because   is a result of your subconscious, and trying to consciously think your way out of it is like trying to put out a fire when youre a mile away from it. In other words,   is the independent variable, while conscious thought is the dependent variable.   affects your conscious mind, and your conscious thoughts are directly affected by how much   you are experiencing.   At this point you might be wondering how its possible to stop   without conscious thought. The system I teach is broken into 2 phases. The first phase is to stop thinking. Its that simple. But you will likely face a common difficulty. You tell yourself to stop thinking, or you try to stop thinking, by thinking. As an anxious person, I cant stand having to fix a problem without putting conscious thought into it. But thats exactly what I had to do. To stop thinking, the best way I can describe the process is building a barrier that prevents any thoughts from entering my head. What will happen is you can ""feel"" thoughts trying to come in, and you stop them before they become a bigger problem.  Now, let me explain what is occurring when you block thoughts from entering your head.   is basically like a cannon, launching ""cannonballs"" of anxious thoughts at you. Thats how we experience  . It starts as a simple thought being launched into our head, and it sprouts into a series of irrational thoughts. Thats why you have to prevent the thoughts from entering your head in the first place, because once theyre there, they are hard to get rid of. DO NOT TRY TO GET RID OF THOUGHTS WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY IN YOUR HEAD. Its impossible. Remember, the only thoughts you can prevent are the thoughts that are being ""launched"" at you, you cant get rid of the thoughts that have already landed.  Now, I like to call the first phase of the system a sample of the ultimate goal, that being a state of mind of very little mental consciousness. It is a state of mind you cannot describe with words, because you are not consciously interpreting what is occurring in your head. The way you get to this point is by, of course, entering the first phase, or preventing thoughts from entering your head. Now, when you are doing this, you are putting a conscious effort toward preventing thoughts. However, you dont want to have to expend this effort for the rest of your life. Like any muscle, it can be activated subconsciously after repetition. The best way I can describe the transition stage is that you get tired of putting forth an effort toward preventing thoughts. When this mental exhaustion kicks in, you will notice that you will want to enter a state of mind that can only be described as natural. There is no conscious effort to remain in this state of mind, it is just you existing, without the necessity of thought to remain there. Essentially, you are in a state with no conscious thought, but you are not putting a conscious effort to be there. This is the frame of mind that you ultimately want to live in.   hardly affects you, because you are living without the need to consciously think, and you have learned to control what goes on in your head.  I know that everything Im saying may make no sense to anyone out there, and I apologize for that. I just thought that if I could help others going through what Ive been going through, then I know that all this effort to get rid of   is something other people can benefit from, as well as myself.",1553876758,1553876761,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b6zcqn/system_for_getting_rid_of_anxiety/,False,False,0.0

So my boyfriend hasn’t been diagnosed with an   disorder, but I think if he went to the doctor they would definitely have something to say. He won’t.   He’s always been fairly anxious about things.

He’s in his second semester of a university where all the professors seem to think their class is the only class he’s taking and so they assign so much work. He’s not a native speaker so it’s hard for him sometimes and the work takes longer and definitely reflects he’s not a native speaker but he still does pretty well.

He doesn’t really sleep anymore and is always checking for assignments. He said he feels that he can’t relax, can’t stop thinking about school and doing homework and worrying about grades or missing something to the point that he feels like he’s going to have a mental breakdown and has burnt himself out because he can’t see his breaks as a break.

I’m struggling dealing with my anxieties recently, and it’s causing problems in my relationship. I tend to catastrophize everything - I’ll take something said to me by my SO and twist it in my head into the worst possible version of what it could have meant, and then run with it in my head. This often makes me think I’m in a bad relationship and that she is a heartless bitch. But when I’m not twisting, I know this isn’t true.   My natural reaction seems perfectly logical to me when I’m doing it, but I’ll just start being snippy with her and accuse her of being malicious. It’s come to the point where she asks why am I with her, if I think she’s such a bitch? And she’ll cry about how awful I think she is, etc.   For some background, I know I have been manipulated in the past, by exes, parents, the catholic church, bosses, friends…. Guilt trips seem to be everywhere around me and I might be seeing them where they really arent. The fact that I’m aware of my   and my ability to distort reality makes it hard to tell IF i am actually being mistreated (or if I ever was in the first place, with exes, parents, church, etc.)   All of this stuff makes it hard to exist, and while I’m nowhere near the line of suicide, I often just find pleasure in thinking about crawling into a hole and never talking to anyone ever again.

I went to college but had a mental break, dropped out, moved across the country to Colorado to live with a boy I had been dating for a few months.    I never finished college and I dont have a degree. I landed on my feet and got a sweet gig at a doctors office. Im an optometrist technician and you dont need a degree for it. I make $15 and hour. I am utterly trapped. Let me tell you why I hate my job.    - the patients. I cant tell you how many times Ive been shit on because I couldnt find a patients insurance. If they were late and needed to reschedule. If something that is 100% their fault, it becomes my fault. Ive had people throw their IDs at me. Ive had people so mad they were visibly shaking. People fucking suck   -my co-workers. They call out all the time. I get called in because Im in a leadership position. Yesterday I requested the day off for a doctors appointment. I requested the day off weeks in advance and it was approved. Someone called out yesterday and they expected me to go in. It took everything for me to not quit right then. Anytime upper management requests a day off, if you reach out to them they will straight up ignore you. Im expected to come in on a day where I notified them I had something going on and I would be unavailable. I got into a huge argument with my manager about that and Im looking for other jobs.    The thing is, without any education Im stuck. I will not be able to find something where I make as much as I do now. I need to get out of this place. I have panic attacks daily about work.

1196,rhorains,1.0,It's becoming more and more difficult to feel normal,"Life has become torture. Ive turned into a shell of what I used to be, which was never much to begin with. I remember growing up fairly happy. I would play with friends and enjoy hobbies as if tomorrow would never come. Now its as if Im always living in tomorrow, never the present.   I lost my mother at 14 years old to a fatal asthma attack. From there I started pushing everyone away because I just couldnt be happy and carefree like everyone else was. Their problems seemed so small and I couldnt stand what normal people considered a ""bad day"". It began to sicken me, and I became envious and angry at everyone.  I discovered marijuana shortly after my mom passed and it was a godsend. I could escape to a place where I felt content with everything and everyone.  When I was 19 I met the woman of my dreams and we moved in together.  I continued to experiment with drugs and eventually it led to me trying methamphetamine. I was actually sold meth instead of cocaine by someone I thought I could trust at the time. Ending up doing too much and almost lost my life. Nothing has been the same since then.  I was able to quit meth but the near death experience changed me forever. My limbs went completely numb that night and I was barely able to dial 911. This was my first panic attack of many and became the PTSD event Ill never forget. Talking to the responder as the ambulance arrived calmed me down enough that I decided to turn away the ambulance when they arrived, but this night is still as fresh and scary in my memory as if it just happened yesterday.  Ever since then I get panic attacks from any unfamiliar body sensation. Like, heart palpitating, limb-numbing, im-about-to-die panic attacks. Some days are okay, some no so okay, and some just miserable. Something as natural as bad gas will send me into a panic because I think my heart is about to stop, the cyclical thinking takes over and Im done for.   I found alcohol at a young age and eventually became a severe drinker for about 5 years (21-26). Alcohol made everything okay. I started drinking all day every day. The girl I mentioned earlier was a heavy drinker as well. We got married.  Last year she was driving drunk and got into a fatal accident. We had been togther for 7 years. Ive also lost a sister to heroin and my closest friend to a heart attack. All of these instant deaths just reaffirm my belief that Im going to die instantly at some point, so Im constantly anxious and plagued with apprehension about when this will happen.  I gave up drinking last year after my wife passed. It has been hard but Im doing a little better with the alcohol dependancy out of the picture. Im currently clean and sober but have been taking kratom occasionally.  I go to therapy and I like it, it helps, but its no cure for my problem.  I barely eat or sleep these days. I can hardly breathe.   I have no friends. I had to move back home with my dad and stepmom but I dont get along with either of them too well. Im just a weirdo and no one understands me.  I feel like Im going to die any moment and its tormenting me. Im always on the verge of the next panic attack.  I dont know what to do. I want it to be over but I also fear death.

After recently winning three awards and a scholarship in a row (I’m not going to what kind of awards for the sake of privacy). My dad literally told me at breakfast yesterday that I “shouldn’t expect that for every thing I do.” Maybe it’s just   reading too hard but it seems like his message was that I’ve peaked and it’s a guarantee that I’ll never be as successful as I am now at seventeen.   is also seeming to always tell me that something bad is bound to happen. Since I’ve already had it “so good” the rules dictate that I’m going to get mugged or my grandma gets hit by a car or [fill in the blank].

I also think it’s worth noting that my parents had very high expectations of me growing up, they enrolled me in tons of private music lessons and advanced classes and all of that. I did okay in all of these endeavors but I never excelled. Sometimes I think this constant pressure to be competitive and to excel from them might have set my standards for myself really high, and now I feel that I’ll never be good enough.   Despite these being very likely reasons for my feelings of inadequacy, I also think that maybe I’m right. I’m extremely clumsy and forgetful, and I’ve never been really, really good at something. There are so many little things that are easy for other people but are hard for me. I am so uncoordinated that I utterly fail at any kind of sports or even simple things like frisbee. I don’t thing I’ve won any kind of strategy game in my life, like chess. Whenever I attempt to play board games with others it’s exceedingly hard for me to understand the rules and remember them. In my time of taking music lessons and performing, it took me a really long time to “get” music and how to feel rhythm and count and all of that, and even then it was such a struggle for me to mentally juggle all of the things required to play an instrument, especially when I had debilitating performance  . It took me so long to understand simple math concepts, far behind all of my peers. There were so many times in school that things clicked for other people easily but not for me. I usually go into things expecting to fail or unable to understand them.   I want so badly to be someone who is tenacious and competitive and calm and collected, but instead I feel like an anxious klutz who struggles with simple task. I can’t tell you all of the times that after I mess up at something, the people around me just give me the most unbelieving look, like they can’t believe I’m actually that stupid.  I think the reason I’m being pushed to post this is because I recently started dating someone. I didn’t want a serious relationship and usually avoid them because I know they’ll eventually see how anxious and stupid I am. But I ended up really liking him, and he seems to like me. Because we’ve been spending so much time together, all of my inadequacies are inevitably beginning to show. I’ve made many clumsy mistakes in front of him, like dropping things or tripping a lot when we went hiking once. Sometimes he said something sarcastic and I didn’t get it. But perhaps the worst is that a few days ago he tried to teach me how to play frisbee golf, and I was so nervous and shy that I usually messed up my throws, and he completely delighted in how awkward I was, teasing me and saying that it was cute. Today we came across a bunch of games in the student union of our college when we were bored between classes, like foosball and shuffle board and tiny basketball games. He made me play all of them, and I failed fantastically at all of them, and he thought it was so funny. He literally said that he was making me play these games just because he knew I was clumsy and would mess up and he thought it was really cute. In all of those moments I laughed and teased him back, but inside I’m so full of dread. Right now he thinks I’m cute, but eventually he’ll be frustrated at all of my inadequacies. They’ll keep happening and adding up, and he’ll realize that I am actually stupid and unskilled at literally everything. I can’t imagine being attracted to someone who is just so outstandingly bad to average at everything they do. One day he’ll want to be with someone who has the tenacity and skill that I lack.   But, I know I’m being insecure and projecting and that’s dangerous, but a part of me genuinely believes that will happen and that no one will think I’m worthwhile long term because of how unsatisfactory I am. But are these feelings just my   haunting me and twisting my perception of myself, or are they valid?  I’m not sure why I’m writing this. I know it must be really long by now, I guess I just wanted to vent somewhere where I thought people might understand. Thank you to anyone who actually read this whole thing.

Moreso at restaurants because you are pinned to a specific table vs. somebodys home where you can move about the house until the meal is served.  I think its because its a situation where getting up and leaving would seem very abnormal, so in a sense I feel trapped. Even if its just socially. I find myself gunning for the corner seat of a booth or table just in case of emergency. If I have a dinner at 5pm, Im already thinking about that corner seat at 2pm and how I can position myself while being seated to get it! And dinners are such a direct way of communicating. Everyone is squared up to each other across the table, static in their position, high emphasis on individual speaking, eye contact. Its alot for the average overthinker!

Its only been a few days since I started the new med but I feel more like myself then I have in years. So to all of you struggling with   and depression your not alone. DONT GIVE UP! Keep moving forward! Do that thing that use to make you happy even if you havent wanted to do it for a while. Find someone to talk to that understands the way you feel or someone who has been there if anything Ill talk with you. And dont be afraid to ask for help..

She will cry and have panic attacks before work, during work and after her shift. She would stress about what she did and what she did not do. Now let me start of by stating that I am also a nurse so I do understand the stress of the job.  Many people close to her told her to get help and get on meds. I understood that the job was the variable once we get rid of the variable she might get back to baseline. That was my original advice, but since then she has become a lot more depressed and stressed that I recommenced getting help and or getting on medication so she can just focus and remove the fog of depression/ .  She put in her two week notice a few days ago because her mental health has taken a dive. She did self harm by hitting her thighs and arms but this only started happening since she started working med/surg and has been getting a lot worse this past month or so. She also has been having thoughts of suicide recently. She is a great nurse and understands the entire clinical picture, but due to her   and subsequent depression I am at a loss. I am just looking for advice or critiques on my advice to her. I love her dearly and just need help!

I brought up to my parents that I might want to go to a new dentist office a few days ago, but my dad made fun of me saying “how long does it take for you to go get ramen? Are ramen noodles more important than your teeth?” Etc etc   Not wanting to be made fun of like that anymore and wanting to get him off my back, I called to make an appointment to the original dentist for today. So I put it in my gps and go off after work.  Problem? I put in the wrong address (it’s the same exact street number apparently) and I ended up on a more sketchy part of town instead.  I tried asking for the correct address from the receptionist and all the stress of not knowing where I was, the traffic in the background, being scared of being made fun of more, and not making it to the appointment on time just got to me and I had a panic attack with her on the other end. I also pulled over to a car washing station while these guys who worked there asked what was wrong with me and got me a bottle of water. In the end I ended up in the totally wrong direction and I had to cancel the appointment and go home.   I just....ugh. I’m just so embarrassed and I hate myself for it getting that bad. All because I wanted to get an appointment and ask about my wisdom teeth since my boyfriend got his removed last week. I thought I was getting better too.   Thanks for listening to me.

1259,TimberFrog,1.0,Can the anxiety of developing Schizophrenia and maybe stress from School develop into Schizophrenia?,"Hey guys,  I have been worrying a lot with developing Schizophrenia over the past two weeks.  As well, I also had three school projects that were my final projects, but I had to ask an extension for one of them. I was wondering if the fear of developing Schizophrenia and the stress from the projects can develop into Schizophrenia? I have not heard voices or any visual hallucinations, except for a yell outside when I was working at the Library. I went to the therapist twice today and they said I seemed fine, though recommend I see a psychiatrist. I saw a counselor last week and she said I was not schizophrenic, as she had experience with dealing with schizophrenics in the past.  However, I had a stressful argument with my friends on Monday and now I am worried that may have triggered it. I have struggled with these intrusive thoughts, that I repeat to myself are not true and sometimes I do this over and over again.  My questions are as: Does Schizophrenia appear out of the blue? Would it develop 1 week after the counselor said I did not have it? Can the stress that comes from the   of developing it turn into it?   When I have the intrusive thoughts,  I realize they are not based in reality and I try to break them down.  Like today, I had a random thought, which I got the idea of from reading an article about what someone with Schizophrenia went through.  It was something about my head not being real or something, and I went like ""No, that is a crazy thought. That is not based in reality. If it was, I would be freaking out but im here typing up my essay."" Is this a sign that I am going crazy or my   taking over?  For anyone who has had this  , how did you shake it off.

She quickly became interested in me, despite having a boyfriend... they’d been together 8 years, but it was a very destructive on/off relationship.

Totally understandable.  She ended up blocking me a few days later, it’s been months and I’m still blocked.

1285,DepressedBandBoi,1.0,I asked a girl to prom,"Ok, only kind of... I was planning to.  For a little context I liked a girl in my jazz band a grade above. She started talking to me more and looked at me and smiled at me a lot. She went out of her way to talk to me or for me to sit next to her a lot so I was pretty confident she liked me. With the help of a friend, I was planning on asking to prom on Tuesday, because the friend was dress shopping with them then. The senior band goes on a trip and both of them left, and I was really excited for when they got back.  One day during the trip my friend snaps me saying that she has a prom date already. I asked, and she said that they are going as friends but that she liked him. I tried to casually ask her if she was going to prom, and told her that I was going to ask. She replied with sorry and a frowny face. My friend seems to feel really guilty about it too. I don know why I am making this, but I am really sad. I havent had any motivation to anything at all lately. Normally I at least enjoy band but I just dont want to do anything. Every time my parents arent home I have just been crying and trying to find stuff to do, so I can think less. I have never wanted to commit suicide, but over these past 2 days, it seems like nothing else will help. I just dont want to feel like this anymore. We play a song in jazz that she solos on called Dream of the Return. It is a slow sad song, and I cant stop listening to it and making me feel bad. If they end up just going as friends, I can see about getting a date after prom, but I dont know how likely that seems. I havent been talking to any of my friends and went invisible on all media.

But I feel like it’s something along those lines.      Instead of explaining my entire life here, I’m just going to share one scenario/example of something I may/did go through with a little background.      So, I’ve always had this problem with social situations where I find it difficult to be confident and not expect it to turn awkward. And this makes it really difficult to build any sort of relationship or even hold a decent conversation without myself making the other person feel uncomfortable and projecting my unconfident energy through the air. This makes the air very tense and then they just end the conversation as quickly as possible so that they can leave.      But, I don’t feel socially anxious or nervous, I just seem to be waayyy too much in my head and worrying about showing myself as confident and this makes me analyze my every single body language movement and my voice tone as I speak. Man, it ruins everything because you just cannot function normally when you’re this much inside your head.     It feels almost as if I’m trying too hard to be confident, and it’s very obvious to other people and they don’t like it and see me as fake and trying to be someone I’m not. But, the thing is, I naturally feel confident! My body language in every situation is that of a confident person, because I feel like a confident person. It’s just whenever I have to communicate, there’s some blown fuses causing malfunctions.      Now for the CLIMAX-----------------------     Here’s where it gets frustrating…     There are times where I feel very confident. It’s like everything is aligned in the world and I feel just like a normal person. I feel as if I act and think just like a normal person. I’m able to stop negative thinking and overthinking almost right away, no  /fear when talking to anyone. I feel like I’m intimidating to others when I talk with them. People magnitude more towards me and want to be with me and talk with me.     This can last for minutes, several hours, days, and the longest was around 1.5 weeks.     But, this always wears off or eventually gets taken away ALL OF A SUDDEN. For example, I’ll be hanging out with friends and having an amazing time because everything is aligned for me. Then, OUT OF THE BLUE, my mind will think thoughts asking me why I feel good and if I really deserve it and how long can it last and I’m meant to be negative thinking and then before I know it… I’m back to everything being unaligned and I’m now constantly inside my head.     \----------------------     I don’t know if I actually have a problem, or it’s just a lack of confidence, or if I just need to make some lifestyle changes.

1308,SophieSpider27,1.0,A win against anxiety Boss Confrontation,"It is that time of year when we have to set our annual goals at work. Wednesday when I went to enter my goals into the system I noticed that there were three Developmental Goals already prefilled in from my boss.   During our face to face review he had told me that certain higher ups in the company felt I had a reputation for being an ""iron fist."" They felt I got joy out of punishing people and destroying them.   My job involves having to issue disciplinary action. I also issue exceptions among other things. I was an auditor for many years so I am good at my job and finding things. I also have a good sense when someone is lying and usually I am right. I have   which gives me super power of hyperfocus. When I get a problem to research my mind can go many directions at once and I often find things my coworkers missed or wouldnt have seen.   Issue is when I find these things even if they are really bad and I am only trying to protect firm, the people who get in trouble report it up the chain of command. Rather than saying good job this ruffles feathers so my boss said I need to work on image.   I get compliments from other team members on my knowledge and work ethic so dont think I am actually a terrible person. Due to my   and terrible   I also go out of my way to please people and stay late regularly to get things done for people.   So back to my goals. I read them and immediately want to go in bathroom and cry. The goals all have to do with ""improving my demeener."" They make me sound like I am the most terrible person and worst employee ever. They were terribly written using definitives like always and never. I felt like if I signed off on them that I was admitting to things I dont do and it would be setting me up for getting fired. Everything he wrote was a nightmare for a person with  . All those things you try not to be and that you fight every day he was implying I did.   My boss has lost his temper with me a few times over ridiculous misunderstandings. Like one time we had a scheduled meeting. I cant see him from my desk. I asked co-worker to see if he was on phone because she can without getting up. My boss calls me in office yelling at me about how disrespectful I am and how I dont respect his boss (he was on phone with his boss I didnt even know this). I tried to explain that I didnt know what he was talking about but he cut me off. He said, ""I think you do. I am on phone in here talking to my boss and you cant respect that. You have Lorena checking in on me. You cant respect my authority or my bosses. When I am on phone with my boss you need to understand that is more important than you!"" Wth  At this point I cant even talk back or explain myself because my   has me completely shut down just trying not to shake or cry. I know how he acts is inappropriate but I fear confrontation because I dont want to breakdown in tears. My coworkers tell me from expericenc I need to just yell back and that is how he will stop and gain respect... Wtf this isnt animal kingdom.   So back to goals. After reading them I showed some of my friends and they were mortified. They said they were terribly written and made me sound awful. One friend suggested asking my boss for specific examples of my behavior that meets what was written. Another said I should rewrite them and present them to him the next day to see if he would sign off. Both of these ideas sounded great but I couldnt sleep all night even with guanfacine.   At work the next day I reworded the goals. Not changing the goal itself but writing them in a way that wasnt attacking. I took some xanex courage in the morning. Then during my meeting he wasnt in a very good mood but I went forward anyway. I asked if we could go over my goals because I felt they made me sound like both a terrible person and employee. He seemed genuinely concerned and said it wasnt the intent. I nervously showed him my changes. At first he started to push back but I told him to keep reading so he could see it still had same end goal. I pointed out I removed the word ""always"" because I dont ALWAYS come to him to make decisions. I make a lot of them on my own (the goal said that I need to learn I dont always need to go to him to make decisions.) He laughed and said well it feels like it. I asked if his wife gets upset when he uses words like always and never. He turned beat red and said yes and I cant believe you called me out on that. I told him my husband knows those words are fighting words in our house. We laughed about it because it is for them too. In the end he agreed to changes and signed off.   Was it nerve-wracking to stand up for myself yes. I could have just signed off on it but it would have made my   worse. I would have felt like I had a target on my back. I thought about HR but I do like my job. I am glad I made myself vulnerable by expressing how the goals made me feel and presenting a solution that fit both parties interests. This might seem minor sorry for length of story but this was huge win for me.

I notice that I constantly yawn/take deep breaths and sometimes my breaths are unfulfilling, where I have to do it again until “my breath goes in.” I also recently noticed that I breathe with my mouth instead of my nose (which is weird). I’m starting to correct my breathing as nose breathing is the way to go except when exercising.   I went to my doctor about it and he said it’s most likely   and not asthma related, although i’m not sure what i’m anxious about. Online says people get anxious about “not being able to breathe properly”, and that scares them.   I’m posting here to see if people in this group have something similar, and if so how are you or how did you guys deal with it?

When I started this job I told myself I wasnt going to get attached to anyone. Not because Im a huge bitch, but mostly because I was trying to focus on myself and hold down a job. In particular, there was this girl who was super cheerful and it annoyed me. She got along great with everyone, and even her boyfriend worked at the same place. Needless to say, she is very happy go lucky, thin, smart, athletic, happy, I guess everything I wish I could be. Yesterday we got a call from her family saying she had jumped off a bridge. Shes in the hospital and unconscious. We have no idea when or if she will ever wake up. When my boss told me, I immediately started having an internal   attack and I cried after getting home.   I feel very stupid because this has impacted me greatly. I spent some time with this person, but mostly tried to keep my distance, and didnt even try to befriend her. Even during a staff lunch, she sat next to me and I tried so hard to avoid a long conversation with her. I guess the guilt is eating me up inside, I cant seem to figure out what made her so unlikable to me. I am so confused as to why someone so happy and smart would do this. I feel like a horrible person. Im going through so many emotions at the same time, and of course now my   is through the roof.

I ""grew up"" online, when I was 11 I joined my first chat room and by the time I was in high school I got into PC gaming. Now, with basically all of my friend groups, I have a discord server with them in which we can chat and play games.      There has been many a night where I have stayed up late playing video games. I do this with my boyfriend too. The problem with this is, is that all of my friends and acquaintances seem to not have a job and school like me. Most of my friends are in school without any sort of job, so they have a lot of free time to play games. Even my boyfriend pursues video games to a degree where its an actual hobby. He is on a team for a competitive game and has practice for two hours every week day and games on the weekends, all while trying to stream and go to school. I already know that I dont want a life where Im always playing video games into late hours of night, I want a more fulfilling life beyond that.      Being surrounded by this culture, while trying to get better, has me tumbling back into my old habits again and again. I acknowledge that its not my friends fault by any means, because their life is their life. But I cant get a grasp on the fact that me, someone who works 20+ hours a week, with three classes, and hoping to move onto bigger and better things in life, needs different daily habits and will most likely have a vastly different schedule from those peers.     One unfortunate thing is Im currently trying to move out of the city I live in and so Im taking online classes, which doesnt help me get out and meet a new social circle. I can feel the   of losing my boyfriend or my friends holding me back from reaching my new potential.

But its easily a 25 minute drive.  Im nervous that she lied so she could have a different person over to sleep with.

1341,TheKingConnie,1.0,Hypochondria/Anxiety,"Im making this post in the hopes that other people have similar experiences. In August of 2018 I suddenly had some chest pain one day and was convinced that I was having a heart attack. I, of course, looked up the symptoms and suddenly felt like I was experiencing them. I went to the doctor a few days later and they did an EKG and said it looked completely normal and told me it was likely  /panic. Ever since then Ive had hypochondria to where any physical feeling feels like a symptom of a disease. Im very good about staying away from WebMD and other sites like that because the last thing I need is to learn more diseases.     Over the last three months Ive been feeling better mentally (not finding myself ridden with fear of dying, not being overly anxious, etc.) but still find that my body feels off. Ill randomly feel a shortness of breath where it feels like each breath is only 75% of a normal breath. I dont end up hyperventilating or breathing any harder or faster, but still feels like Im not getting full breaths. In addition to the shortness of breath, Ill occasionally get random light-headedness, headaches, pounding heart, or a random twitch feeling in my chest that almost feels like your heart pauses for a half a second but then passes.      So my question is, does anyone else feel similar random feelings that come out of the blue? I have always understood   to be something that starts mentally and then proceeds to give you physical symptoms but I find myself feeling physical things and then proceeding to worry about them. Ive had my heart checked multiple times and every test turns out completely normal, yet I then start to worry its something with my brain or some form of cancer, etc. My biggest thought that I cant get around is why do these physical feelings occur even when Im not mentally anxious at all.

Some backstory: I am leaving my job to take my last pre-requisite course needed for med school. My boss is unhappy because I have to leave during a ""busy"" time of year, but I dont have a choice--I need to do what I need to do for my future. My boss was hesitant about taking me back afterward, which I can understand, but it wasnt what I expected after how he acted towards me in the past and in my recommendation letter, making me suddenly feel pretty worthless. So Im getting no help at work finding someone to replace me. We have an office manager, but shes not doing her job of hiring someone and Im afraid its all going to fall on me. I dont want to leave on bad terms. When Im not at work Im working on my personal statements for my upcoming applications, worrying about the cost of the upcoming course, and balancing some personal health concerns. I feel like I am drowning. I spend my nights crying randomly, and I cant escape the constant feeling of panic and dread. My body constantly feels like its vibrating as if Ive had caffeine (which I avoid). I am taking out my frustrations on my family and I know I shouldnt. I am recognizing how I am acting, but I am ashamed that I am not able to stop it in the first place. The worst part is I know I have NO reason to be this stressed.     The upcoming course is a whole semester of work in one month. Ive felt confident I can do it as I am dedicating all of my time to it, but considering how I am handling this level of stress now I am doubting myself. Plus, if I cant manage this stress now, how am I going to manage the stress of school and my career down the line?     I was the victim of an assault in my undergraduate years that left me with a severe concussion. He always recommended yoga and deep breathing to practice mindfulness. I practiced yoga for a bit, and that was nice, but I have a hard time committing to it on my own and I cant get to classes with my current schedule. Deep breathing and meditation does NOTHING for me. I just cannot get my head into it. Even therapy was hard for me because finding someone you feel in tune with is hard, and starting over constantly is emotionally draining. I have found that sitting down and doing coloring books with music has helped me. And of course, my dog. I play video games, but thats mind\*less\*.     I guess I am venting a bit, my main purpose here is to get some advice on how to manage. I know there are countless stress management techniques to be found on Reddit.

I’m forever musing, My “self-awareness” a mere burden. Caught up in thoughts that never end. No clarity in sight.  It is okay for me to have flaws? Right?  It’s okay for me to not know something? Right?  It’s okay for me to lag behind? Right?  Is it? Sometimes I don’t know.  Everything is my next big project. Every project must be a big project. Every doable project must be my project. My mind works at a rate of knots. Why shouldn’t my body?  I don’t need rest, I tell myself as I sit at my table. Doing nothing. Others are working, I tell myself. You should too.  Motivation is always good. Right?  I know my limits. Right?  I have to catch up with the lead pack. Not tomorrow, not today.Yesterday.  You see, there’s so much that they know that I don’t. I should devour every morsel of knowledge until I’m ahead.  Ahead of everyone, an undisputed number one. I fail to see they are learning too.  Does it matter that I know something else? NO.  Does it matter that I am taking positive steps, At my own pace? NO  Does it matter that others have a head start? NO.  Does it matter that THEY took a long time to reach where they are? NO  You see, I am caught up in what’s isn’t there.  What’s elusive and just beyond my reach.  I don’t want it tomorrow, I don’t want it today. I want it yesterday.  There is no placating me. No consolation prize.  You see, I’m caught up, I’m stuck. I fell upon a tangle of weeds.  I don’t want to be water. 75% of the world isn’t enough.  Everything must be covered, till there’s nothing left to see.  It’s all or nothing and anything short of everything is nothing.  You see, I’m pining and I’m whining and I’m barking up trees.  I’m a child with a box of toys. I want it all.  What she has is better, and I’m sick of my fortunes.  My decisions are forever wrong and I want to pursue what I never truly wanted.  What I want, I can’t wait for.  Baby steps?  “ You’re 21”. I tell myself.  I am a pyromaniac, I love a good burnout.  I am a masochist, I want to watch myself in pain.  Put two and two together and I love burning out.  I don’t want to be this way.  I want to back myself.  I want to enjoy life.  Forever chasing? No, I’d rather be happy and content.  There’s more to life than an eternal race.  Everyone knows that.  Everyone but me.  Right now, life’s a cycle.  From a zealot to burn-out.  Once enthused, now apathetic.  Forever cycling between extremes.  My decisions were right for me,I often remind myself.  I can compensate for my flaws, or so I’d like to believe.  Strengthen in a few places, that should be more than enough for me.  Can I be perfect?   Can I do it all?   I’d like to. But I know it’s not on the cards.  You see, that’s the line. The line between being stuck and growing.  Between knowing I’m flawed and remaining stuck in my flaws, trapped in my head.  A line that separates “positive steps” from “unhealthy obsession.”  A line, that ironically enough marks “can” from “cannot”  I am not perfect, but I can get where I want to get; or; I am imperfect and I’ll never be where I want to be.  If I take positive steps I’ll get there.  I can’t bite off more than I can chew.  I’d only choke to death, but where’s the fun in that.  Today? Tomorrow? I don’t really care.  If I just do my thing, I’ll eventually get there.  Maybe not a mountain top but only a mere plateau.

In short, I’ve had GAD for a long time (untreated, because I tried convincing myself I didn’t have anything wrong - do not recommend). Around fall of last year things really began to spiral out of control, and by nov/dec I was barely able to leave my house, having daily panic attacks, depressed and had to go on leave from my job. Over the next few months with counselling and medications I improved greatly and while I’m not 100% I’m much better than I was.   I was previously working full time in healthcare at a very stressful job that I hated before going on leave. When I can back from leave, I moved to a much less stressful position and temporarily cut back to part time. At present I go 3 days a week for 6 hours for the last month and it’s been working well for me, pays enough to cover bills, etc. Eventually when my doctor recommends it’s time I will go back up to 5 shifts of 8 hours again. However in the mean time I am struggling so hard with not beating myself up about being on reduced hours and having to do less than I was before. Even though right now the thought of working full time right now is very overwhelming.

Help?  For some background, I have had   for as long as I can remember. It got really bad a couple years ago when I was in grad school, but now I am on medication that works very well for me and my life is more stable so I generally feel pretty good. Went from weekly crying jags to just one panic attack in the last 6 months and my husband was able to calm me down in minutes. I am not in therapy due to the cost and I haven’t seen the need for it.  I decided recently that I want to learn to shoot and get my concealed carry license. My dad is an experienced marksman and hunter, so he is teaching me and in a few weeks I will start the concealed carry course. We had our first session of target practice yesterday and it went very well! My dad was really patient, didn’t push me and listened whenever I was nervous about something. Things did get a little scary at the end when their dog got out and came running over and jumped up at me, but I held very still and kept the gun pointing up and carefully turned the safety on while my dad got the dog under control. Other than that it was great.  I had absolutely no   issues during the practice, or that evening. However when I went to bed, my brain immediately started playing all the scenarios where something could’ve gone wrong. *What if you shot your dad, what if you shot the dog, what if the dog jumped on you and you dropped the gun and it shot you in the face, here let’s imagine in detail how your dad’s screams would sound if he saw you blow your brains out, it would only take a second for something terrible to happen and you can’t possibly be vigilant every single second, you’ll mess up and hurt someone and it’ll be all your fault.* Eventually at 2am I was so anxious I threw up (sorry, gross) and finally slept after that. I took an extra dose of my meds but I’m still really shaky and my heart is pounding.  This is kind of both an off-my-chest and looking for advice. Is anyone here experienced with guns (or similarly dangerous situations) and dealing with   surrounding that? How do you cope, does it get easier? I really don’t want to give up on this.

Without sounding like Im boasting, I had a great family, great friends, great childhood, etc etc etc... So why if everything seemed like I should have everything under control, why was I struggling so bad with what I considered to be crippling   and depression?     Well, lets get one thing straight.      You do not need a reason to be anxious.      Nor do you need a reason to be depressed, angry, upset, sleeping terribly, drinking, fearful...\[insert your personal ailment here\]...     Now, mental health issues can often be caused by traumas weve experienced in life and often in childhood. Have a phobia of water and you almost drowned when you were younger? Makes complete sense. And Im really sorry for those of you that do have experiences like this one or worse, Ive heard some nasty things over the years and some of you are just amazing for being able to keep going after such horrendous ordeals.     But there is not always some defining moment, one particular thing, that results in these issues. If this is you and you feel like you dont have a reason... then you can stop it right now and completely dismiss that ridiculous idea. Its not helping you, in fact its most likely causing you guilt and more stress actually making the situation worse. Im not saying dont appreciate all the good things in your life, thats completely different. Im saying that the good ""reasons"" in your life, are absolutely irrelevant to why you might be suffering.

Over time, all the tiny things that we deal with can build up too, tiny everyday things that WE ALL GO THROUGH or have been through. e.g education, homework, exams, friendships, relationships, health problems, growing up, embarrasments, worries, fears, responsibilities, chores, job changes, moving houses, break ups, new partners the list goes on and on.      Some of us manage to deal with this stress naturally, and some of us dont.      If youre struggling with these symptoms, theres so many resources about to help you. The internet has next to unlimited supplies of information and tools, other peoples hints and success stories etc etc.      And you have another great resource as well... that big squidgy one behind your eyeballs... (Yes, your brain). You know yourself better than anyone else knows you, figure out what needs to change and take one tiny step towards that goal today, the smallest step you can manage, text a friend, go for a walk, stay off social media for a while, turn the tv off, whatever you think is best for YOU.      Finally, if youre walking this road to recovery by yourself and need some sort of direction, just one simple task to do right now to move towards dealing with your issues, something I hear all the time from people wishing they did this years and years ago. I want you to ask yourself:      How long am I willing to go on with these issues for. How many years. How many months. How many days.      Be honest. Be precise. Be absolutely blunt with yourself.     If by \_\_/\_\_/\_\_\_\_ I havent been able to fix this on my own or if I havent made significant changes that tell me I have this under control, then Im going to seek professional help.     If you do take that advice I would love to hear what date youve set for yourself! :) Peace.",1553788675,1553788677,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b6kjp3/i_have_no_reason_to_have_anxiety_this_mindset_is/,False,False,0.0

Recently I’ve been extremely hyper sensitive to anything that I feel physically. My head has had so much pressure in it and My muscles have been twitching. (Mostly in my toes and sometimes my head jolts) so this made me believe I was going to have a seizure.  earlier this week I left school with a terrible headache which later resulted to me pulling over on the side of the road to vomit. Now I am convinced i have a brain tumor.... I’m just so mentally exhausted from not just being like “oh the pollen count is extremely high I prob had a sinus headache which made me feel sick.” But my thoughts are more like “I have a brain tumor the cancer has probably spread through my entire body and I’ll be dead in 6 months” ",1553787117,1553787119,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b6k81y/health_anxiety/,False,False,0.0

I have a roommate who is dealing with this way better than I am but she also has her boyfriend over all the time to distract her from all this. Sometimes I wish I had someone to physically comfort me through all this but I know thats not the way to solve my problems. But still. I dont know how to manage this fear anymore.

When Im alone on a street I can move about OK, but I forget to walk and get shortness of breath and wobbly if people are approaching me or walking from behind. I wish I could get over this, but I dont know of any strategies to deal with it. The really strange thing is that I tend to walk fine if Im with family or friends, and do pretty well when walking behind others on a busy sidewalk. I desperately want to have a full life without thinking about walking everywhere I go. It should be something automatic, not a thing that I think about.  The only thing I can think of that may have contributed to my fear or walking in public places is that I was bullied hard in elementary school. One incident was where a guy who later apologized for his bullying of me made fun of the way I walked down the hallway. I think he was just being mean but that incident sticks out in my mind. I recently quit caffeine for 60 days and, while that seemed to help a bit, I still have this problem walking.     Also, another thing weighing on my mind is that I havent had a girlfriend since I was 19. The relationship lasted for 9 months and it was mostly awesome. Ive had one night stands a few times in my twenties but no relationships and nothing after 27. Im starting to wonder if Im defective. I really havent put myself out there much, though I did go on a date recently. It went OK but the girl seemed to be unhappy with her life and she uhh didnt match her photo.

I know there is no way in hell he would cheat on me, but I still worry that one day he will. And if i’m not worrying about that, i’m worrying that he’ll leave me BECAUSE i worry so much.

Thing is it’s completely dark and no rational way for me to even have seen supposed “spider” which is how I come to my senses usually with such facts. Most issues involve me getting away from my bed as soon as possible and I always end up in the hall when I fully wake, panting and shaking. I don’t always completely remember what brought me out there, but usually grasp the basic idea behind the panic. One time it was “bears in the closet”.  I’ve had these experiences before (not common in my life though) but they seem to be a bit worse lately. I’m wondering if it’s just the recent stress or if I should talk to a doctor?

Our backgrounds are so different and as a result HOLY FUCK hes made me realize how absolutely broken and dysfunctional I am. He is from a very stable, upper middle class family. I am from a very unstable, fairly low income family. He has lived in one place his whole life. I have moved around a lot.   I always thought mental illness was equal across the board but he is so much better at relating to people, getting work done, and everything important. I think this is most clearly illustrated in our friendships. He hangs out with people his own age all the time. I do only a few times a month at most. Ive realized that because of my past I am literally incapable of making friends. I have no stable friend group. I know like 2 people from before college that I talk to even somewhat regularly. Only 1 that I hang out with. In my two years of college I have not managed to make a single friend that I see on a regular basis for something other than studying/clubs/obligations. I HAVE NO FRIENDS AND I HAVENT SINCE I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. YOU GUYS IM SO FUCKED I LITERALLY CANNOT RELATE TO PEOPLE. My experiences are so outside the realm of ""average American growing up"" that I cant relate to women or men my age. I spent YEARS with minimal contact with people my own age. In 7th grade my only contact was a 2 hour art class once a week that I panicked through.  I thought that since I got over my awkwardness enough to speak to people without being in physical pain from   that I was better. I talked to people, I started studying with people, I had boyfriends. However, I have never had a stable social life post   development. Every time I think Ive fixed something   reappears in a new, sneakier form. My past has also apparently increased my suffering, a lot. I have spent so many years miserable, alone, doing nothing in a stressful household, desperate to escape. It really does take a toll on a person. I didnt realize how much until my boyfriend enlightened me to the life of someone who grew up ""normal."" The problem isnt just my mental illness its also my whole life.      Does anyone else experience this?

1456,softbitch,1.0,"When I get anxious, I get quiet and come off as angry","When I get anxious, my friend asks me if Im angry because I get quiet and stare intensely at things around me. I try to ground myself, and talk myself out of being anxious, but its hard to until I fix it. For instance, I have most recently been anxious about being late enough to a movie that I would miss the beginning. I was anxious and terse until I was in the theater. I was with my friend, who alwyas plans on being On Time, down to the last minute, and had to do a lot of things, last minute, before we left.  Im not angry with her in those situations! I have such high levels of stress that I get frustrated that she has contributed to my  , but then I aggressively talk myself down for being irrationally upset. Again, I get quiet and stare intensely and when people start talking to me, Im very terse because Im internally flipping out and trying to mellow myself out.  My friend always asks me if Im angry with her, and I always say ""No, Im just stressed out and anxious,"" and then she usually says things like ""Were going to be on time"" or ""you can leave without me"" or ""do you even want to go?"" None of these make me feel better because Im irrationally anxious, which I know. So I usually say ""I know, its fine"" or ""Im not leaving without you"" or ""yes, obviously I want us to go"" because those are the Rational Responses that I know to be the Right Way to go about life. Then, my friend gets upset because Im terse and deadpan when I say those responses.  Every time I get anxious and communicate that to her, she accuses me of taking it out on her. Even when I tell her that I am not angry, that I dont blame her, that its fine and Im going to be fine, she gets upset that Im upset. Which is frustrating because I try to be patient and not take it personally when shes anxious/triggered and being terse and deadpan at me!   Basically, any advice for not being terse/deadpan when anxious and with someone else?  Tldr: my friend thinks Im aggro when Im just anxious, how do I stop seeming aggro  ",1553755812,1553755813,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b6fimn/when_i_get_anxious_i_get_quiet_and_come_off_as/,False,False,0.0
1457,SlwDancer,1.0,My friend is going through a lot right now and I want to help him,"I have a friend who is in a terrible spot in life right now and I want to help him through it. To start, my friend in need of help is fifteen years of age, while I am sixteen. Ive known him for a little over two months, and the first time we met he showed me kindness Id never seen in a person before. Now that he is in a time of turmoil I want to be there for him in any way I can. He is suffering the most from deeply rooted self-esteem issues and emotional trauma from being in a toxic relationship. He wears his heart on his sleeve and people have taken advantage of him for it and it really hurts to hear this stuff from him. He wants to be an artist which only further perpetuates his terrible self-esteem and   whenever he makes something he considers bad as a beginner and has few people outside of me and his other friend to talk to. And he is also going through the normal teen crisis of seeing yourself as a nothing but a burden for others. Hes already had to go to the hospital for an attempt on his own life before but does not want to seek help from a psychiatrist because hes not allowed to first talk privately with his doctor, and hes recently talked about considering it again which scares me the most. Ive talked him out of going through with it but it still really terrifies me.  Im talking with him whenever he gets online and I support him to the best of my abilities. Ive never been a sympathetic or empathetic person for personal reasons nor am I entirely familiar with   or dealing with it but Im really trying my hardest for him and I want to do more. I let him know that hes someone truly special and unique in the world because he truly is and that the bad crap that happens to him is not his fault but I feel this isnt enough. I know that growth is likely not going to happen overnight for him and that, for as much as I believe in him, he needs to believe in himself first to make a change which is the hardest thing to do as a third-party whose only means of communication with him is text on a screen. He lives halfway across the United States and I have no means of giving him the physical support he needs. And I just want to help him so he doesnt hurt anymore. Ive talked with him for hours about my belief in him but is there anything more I could do to help him? Whats the best approach to helping someone like him? Are there any forms of online and private help I could recommend to him? Or maybe I should encourage him to not be so private about it and confront his family about his problems? I feel bad talking behind his back like this but its for his sake. I dont know whats the best way to help but I just dont want to see him like this. Any help is appreciated. Ill try to respond with updates or clarification when I get the time if youd like although Im feeling very tired after having just got off talking with him. Ill reply in the morning.

First time posting on this subreddit.,"Good evening I’d like some advice on how to reduce myself from worrying. I assume it may be worrying because it has been keeping me up at night for the past week.   This past week I have been worrying about my future. I will be joining the military in the next month and although I’m excited for the experience and what I’ll learn I’m also worried about it because I’ve never been through something like that.   In addition, I know the military will be physically demanding and although I’m not obese or anything, I am out of shape. I attempt to run and get back into shape like I use to be but I don’t have any desire or motivation. Also, I have been unable to sleep well. My sleep schedule is so screwed that I also begin to worry about my health and how it’ll effect me within the military.   I just simply want to sleep well and get back into shape but worrying makes that simplicity not so simple. Any advice?

1460,pKievit,1.0,Intense Shame Guilt and Worthlessness,"What makes you feel intense shame, guilt and worthlessness? Sex? Porn? Alcohol? Drugs? Cutting? Codependency?  All of our addictions and self destructive behaviors have one thing in common, they provide us with a maladapted form of pleasure and comfort that invariably makes us feel more shame and guilt, forming a self destructive feedback loop.  Many therapists treat the symptoms by distraction with positive activities, or medication to treat the resulting symptoms of depression and  , or maybe they explore what the pay off is that we get from self destructive behaviors and then try to replace them with less self destructive coping mechanisms.  This is like treating a headache with painkillers when the problem is dehydration… dehydration is the cause of the headache and the most effective way of treating your headache is rehydration, perhaps in combination with a pain killer… but to have pain killers every day for the rest of your life for a dehydration headache does not make any logical sense at all.  So too, we need to focus on why we feel intense and disproportionate shame, guilt and worthlessness in the first place.   Usually, most of this sort of thing begins in childhood. In the worst of cases we are violently abused physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically and usually for no reason at all… as a child we then learn that we are essentially a bad, worthless person and we feel intense shame and guilt for being a bad, worthless person, even though we dont know why, and we accept it as fact.  From then on, every “bad” thing we do confirms that we are a bad worthless person who deserves to feel intense shame and guilt. As we get older, things such as masturbation, romance, sex, alcohol, drugs all are viewed as naughty, or bad and by then filling any emotional need, dulling any emotional pain fills us with even more shame and guilt… but by now we accept that a measure of pain, shame, guilt and worthlessness is the “normal” price to pay for a tiny bit of dysfunctional pleasure, comfort or escape.  The cause is easy to identify… early childhood abuse… treating it is difficult, and requires the courage to come face to face with your darkest buried fears and traumas. Most of these intense emotional traumas are almost inextricably linked with thoughts of guilt,  shame and worthlessness… and as such are stored deep in our fight or flight response. That is why we usually first put up strong resistance to probing our childhood traumas… our mind knows that this is an area of extreme seemingly inescapable pain and so must be avoided at all costs, which is yet another reason why distracting ourselves with self destructive behaviors is done.  Lets make it simple… if you were a parent, and a stranger came into the room and started yelling and screaming abuses at your child,  ridiculing and humiliating it and then physically abusing it, what would you do? How would you feel? The appropriate response is to get angry, stand up, fight, defend your child at all costs. WE are that child… and more often than not we tell ourselves that we deserve to feel worthless, ashamed and guilty.  Whatever it takes, dont give in to rage at any individual in the present moment, but in a controlled way do whatever it takes to allow yourself to switch from feelings of guilt, shame and worthlessness into sheer anger and defiance over the abuse and injustice perpetrated against you in your childhood that made you feel that you are a bad person who deserves to feel ashamed, guilty and worthless.  Anger is a very important emotion to master if we want to drive change in our mind and life… not anger at an individual, but anger at the injustice itself so that you reinforce your right and determination to treat yourself better and to start teaching others how to treat you better.  Only after processing our injustices with disdain and anger, in a measured and appropriate amount, can we achieve resolution to the deep psychological scars in our mind and achieve peace and acceptance so that we can move forward in a productive way. ",1553754368,1553754369,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b6fc8c/intense_shame_guilt_and_worthlessness/,False,False,0.0

I havent missed a class in months and its incredible (Im not bragging, my therapist constantly tells me to acknowledge my progress).   However Im not doing well because I have so much   about studying and doing homework. I set aside the time and then I just sit in my room all day browsing the internet not really doing anything, steadily becoming more and more upset. I can email my professors and ask them for more time on assignments and sometimes theyre cool with it because I have the title IX disability thing that lets me turn stuff in late.   When I first started to get bad   and agoraphobia 5 years ago, it started with me not doing assignments, then skipping class because I thought I should stay in my room and work on the assignment (which never happened because I always ended up being too anxious and sad to focus), then just not going because I was already too far behind. I think Im kind of getting better in reverse order: Im able to go to class, and I force myself every time, but still its so fucking hard for me to study. Like Im only taking two classes and I have a part time job, I had literally nothing to do today (Wednesday) but I didnt get anything done at all except spending a few minutes looking at the pdf of some homework.

She said she understands how much it sucks to be lectured by someone who doesnt know what you are going through about how to ""fix it"" and just wanted to reach out and offer her support and let me know I could talk to her if I ever needed to. She went on and told me that for 4 or 5 years she had really bad crippling   and spent years going to therapy and trying diffferent medications to get it under control. I thanked her for reaching out and we talked about other things until we got to my place.     Honestly that was one of the most crazy and moving nights of my life. That somebody who didnt know me at all would remember from months before something I had just barely mentioned and not only reach out to offer their help and support but open up to me about their own experience with  . It is the first time in my life that anyone has ever considered how my   might effect my decisions (whether to take the ride) and actually want to talk about it. It meant so much to me and every time we pass by each other and say Hi at work I remember that night and it really helps with whatever   I might be feeling at the time.     I have been trying ever since  to find an opportunity to thank her and tell her how much it meant to me. She asked me if I needed a ride home again last week but I had other plans so I couldnt take the opportunity.",1553747512,1553747514,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b6efcw/somebody_acknowledged_and_considered_my_anxiety/,False,False,0.0

Ive since reestablished the boundaries, especially on how much of their emotional load I can take. But it still seems like I get a message every week where they expect me to be a friend and a therapist to unload on, and without asking if I have the mental capacity for it, just expecting me to take in deep emotional things and also provide affirmations.

Ever since I was a kid I have always been way too good of a kid, never got in trouble or anything. I never really had many friends and played tons of video games since it took my mind off of my problems. I never knew what   was but Im sure I had it.  Fast forward to about 8th grade it became so bad I dropped out of school and played video games while rarely leaving the house for 5 years. Tried home schooling but my mom was a single mom and didnt know what the hell she was doing. I was too scared to ask anyone for help and I suffered alone.  Im 21 now and have made enormous progress! I have a job and am a very hard worker... Too hard, I stress all day about looking the best I can be. I overwork myself and dont even think twice about it because I am so scared I am going to be told its bad or wrong. Some days I am really relaxed and can talk to anyone. Some days I am so sad and overthink everything.  I recently moved to Alaska with my dad which I was very aware he was an alcoholic but my mom was kinda bad about it as well. Anyway things went bad he started yelling at my sister almost every night and causing problems for everyone. Long story short, very toxic and not calm at all ever. After about 3 months we moved out because he was going to start charging me and my sister $500 each. We were sharing a room with 3 people by the way.  It helped me realise my dad caused this trauma and has really hurt both me and my sister. Me and my sister are extremely close. So she ended moving in with her boyfriend and I had to move in with a friend of his for a while I have been staying there for 2 weeks and I am still rather uncomfortable Im sure that does not help.  Today has been especially bad, I was unaware of what a panic attack was. I have had 3 today while at work, for the first time cried at work. I hated it, it was embarrassing and awful. I dont want to ask my sister for help because its stressing her out. Im leaving to go back to a good friend of mines house to hopefully get my life started on the 22nd of April.   I know I have tons to look forward too but I have always had a pretty fucked case of  . There are quite a bit of details I left out. It would be a book if I were to put most of it.  I just dont know what to do who to ask. I have never been to therapy but I dont know who to talk to. I guess I want some help, I hate asking because I feel like Im feeling sorry for myself. Either way getting to write this somewhere has helped.  Rereading I am having second thoughts about posting since so many details are missing but Im just going to do it or it will never happen.

1492,Throwaway361616,1.0,Anxiety over the idea of adopting a cat.,"So short backstory. My family adopted 2 kittens when I was just 8. They lived to be 16-17 (they both passed away 2-3 years ago), so most of my life that I can remember was spent around cats. They were two of my best friends and their deaths were very tough. They were the only pets Ive ever had.     Fast forward to now, a few years without living with any animals at all. In the last 8 months, Ive moved out for the first time to my own apartment and also got a new full time job. Big life changes give me lots of  , and this winter I suffered the worst   and depression Ive dealt with for a long time. After starting antidepressants, Im finally starting to feel better, and my   has improved a ton.      I consider myself a very independent person overall. Ive never had a problem just spending time by myself. However, there are moments when I do get a bit lonely, and lately Ive been entertaining the idea of bringing a cat or two into my life again for companionship.      I know I could care for cats just fine and I would be able to pay the necessary costs to own them. However...when I sit down and think about actually adopting a cat, my   creeps up. I fear they may be like children - I would have to plan my life around other creatures and wouldnt be able to just live my own life as I do now. I know it sounds horrible, but I get a weird feeling of dread feeling like Im indebted to other creatures for possibly the next 15 years. I know cats are self sufficient, but I feel bad knowing I would be away from my apartment almost daily for 8 hours while Im at work or spending time with family on the weekends. All that being said, when I see a cat Ive spent time with at the shelter gets adopted, I do feel a little disappointment, like I missed out on them. I just feel so torn.     I hope this makes sense. Guess I just needed to vent. Any words of advice if youve been in a similar situation?

1502,InconspicuousName1,1.0,I don't have a personality,"When I was younger, Ive always neglected trying to show empathy or my opinion on things once I realized people criticize you and judge their opinions of you depending on who you are. I was never sure which type of person my self conscious self strived to be like, usually I was split between deciding how I should judge my actions based on who I wanted to be versus my own personal convictions and interests, which was hard because I constantly paired the social structure that happy people are assertive, confident and a certain kind of character, otherwise you dont earn up to the privilege of prioritizing yourself.  Since I chose trying to morph into being the person I wanted to be, I was disappointed at how hard and impossible it is to try to change myself and started to feel that my actions are hopeless and that it is impossible to try to change. Initially I tried being more outgoing, cheery, bright, of which I tried being more loud and tried to push as many bubbly comments as I possibly could, until I realized that regardless of my actions they treated my character as the same person I was before and seemed to make me forgettable than how I was before, which really got to me. It made me feel like there was a pointlessness to my actions, that no matter what I cant change who I am, so I started being more isolated and began to lose faith in myself. As timed moved on, Ive watched my peers around me grow and evolve into more mature yet immature teenagers that have convictions and morph into people who have \*character\*, meanwhile Ive been in a awkward state of deciding who I want to be because I never tried to prioritize my own thoughts and my own self integrity; I constantly distance myself and force myself to believe that I do not own up to such privileges. Its gotten to a point where I tried to shun my own emotions, to prove my independence and maturity when I was so lonely. I used to cry alot everyday because I was constantly reminded of how obsolete I was, and because of that I thought I was weak, so I started to be hard on myself. Nowadays its hard to cry and laugh. I find socializing difficult and acting normally in public challenging.  Now I am almost a senior and see those around me happy with friends, with ambitions, with preferences, with jobs, with relationships, with priorities. I honestly get confused when I see people act a certain way, wondering why acting this way would benefit you, why its so natural, why being this way isnt used to give yourself an advantage you, but actually is who you are and that you dont require the moral decision to be this way, you just are. I honestly wonder how people can innately be like this. I wonder when I let myself go. I wonder how I can make decisions based on my own preferences, how I can attract those who love me for what kind of person I am. Honestly, to find a SO I find it impossible that I could actually find me attractive and funny. I refuse to believe that I can show a personality quirky enough to satisfy each other. I personally have difficulty in making personal replies/comments about my views on things, as I dont choose to have preferences. I feel so distant compared to those around me. Ive always been awkward with others and I found my input invalid every time.

Let me give some context. I’m 17. I never really cared that I didn’t have constantly accessible people other than family members, as some lucky ones have. I never really cared about dating and stuff like that, I felt pretty sufficient on my own.   Thing is, it wasn’t a problem for me.

I.e people come to me when they need help understanding some subject.  During these days I’ve been very harsh on myself for not being able to move past this to other kinds of social interactions with people. I just sit on my corner, pump some music through headphones to focus thoughts on the next class and let the world go on with its business.  I feel awful for not having enough courage to get some REAL conversations out of people. Be it starting one or keep on going. I’m bad at either. It makes me look boring and rude in front of others, because I just avoid talking to anyone.  And I realize I should probably not make myself too available for help because of opportunists who will abuse this trait, but I can’t avoid it.

I was rather overweight as a child, which Ive lost as Ive grown, but I still feel I have bad body confidence issues, to the point where I think about how horrible I must look to someone else while in talking to them   I feel a constant need to apologise and be sorry for my existence to people as I feel in always bugging them or annoying them, and really fear judgement from anyone, especially my friends, who I feel really dislike me, and only spend time with me as they are obligated to and they really dont want have to talk to me.   I want them to feel as happy as possible and thats always been my absolute top goal and I absolutely love them to bits but im riddled with doubt at the fact that one day they might just flip and leave, having never wanted me around in the first place.

I like hugs and things close like that but I cant stand being within maybe a metre and a half of anyone else. I feel incredibly uncomfortable sitting next to someone, and I CANNOT MAINTAIN EYE CONTACT WITH ANYONE.   I doubt everything I say and feel apologetic for them even having to hear me speak.   I always feel very anxious and paranoid about strangers and other people in public, sometimes even people I know that theyre trying to harm me or do me wrong.   I find walking down streets stressful as it always feels as if cars are coming evercloser as they pass me, and that the person walking towards me is judging me and is potentially out to harm me, but I still feel very apologetic about being in front of them. Sometimes I end up apologising as people walk past me habitually.   These issues seem to slowly be taking over my life and im not sure what to do. Its difficult for me to talk to s doctor about it because A. That means initiating  conversation which causes serious problems for me, and B. Im between 16-18 so im unsure how my family would become involved if I were to consult my doctor.

1527,Thought-I-lost-it,1.0,Dad's 4th surgery - spending nights in a hotel,"Hi! How are you?  Im looking for some practical tips and advice. Since October 2018 Im suffering from a breakdown and got a lot of old (managed) anxieties back up front. Even developed some new ones. Sort of like homesick, separation   and afraid of losing my mind or being unable to get out of panic attacks.  My dad has beaten cancer three times, but unfortunately hes been diagnosed for a fourth time. First time he had a tumor in his colon, and then two times tumors in his liver. This time they found a tumor in the tail of his pancreas. Were all still shocked and just cant believe it. The hospital found out because of his regular check ups with scans and taking blood values.   Luckily my dad is really strong and has a determined mindset. Hes a real fighter and proven himself mentally and physically fit in the recoveries. After earlier surgeries he was able to go home sooner than expected.  For the treatment were going to a hospital in Amsterdam, which is an hour drive from where we live. The previous times my mom, sister and her husband and I booked hotel rooms to be near him. To give him the extra family support and confidence he needs.  We booked for 2 or 3 nights, dont remember, and the remaining days we would drive up and down from home in the afternoon/evening.  But now Im in a fallback like I said, and more anxious than normal. Those previous times I felt a bit stronger and more stable. Still it was hard to cope, and be outside your comfort zone and battling with all the mixed emotions. This tine Im really extra scared.  I got the feeling my medication doesnt work that good anymore.  Even before the news of my dads cancer broke out.  My psychiatrist prescribed Risperdal, but that didnt go too well, I felt more   and adrenaline and pressure.  When we agreed to stop the Risperdal, he suggested I could try some Abilify, if I still had the need to get my mind on track. But Im not sure if its the right time to check that out, because what if it all gets worse? My mind tends to get into a big revelation, awareness and realisation of the fact that Im alive and theres nothing I can do. Time keeps ticking, cant stop, cant pause. And its impossible to prevent oneself from all the tragedy that has to come. The existence of loved ones will end. Just like my own.  And one of my fears is that train of thought is unstoppable and holds me in the panic atmosphere and makes me afraid to lose my mind. That night can calm me down.  I know that thats life, and when the time comes, you will find a way to manage the sadness. Thats an instinctive reaction.  I know it gets me nowhere worrying about it now. But its like the heavy feeling of this existential crisis starts before I know what happens. Its all in a split second. Heavy depressed and sad feeling that leads into a panic attack with adrenaline rushing through my veins. After its all in motion the realization comes about what Im feeling. So Im unable to prevent and stop it. Because it takes over...  I cant really remember how I got passed the previous operations of my dad. I know I took a bit more Lorazepam. But I dont know if its gonna be strong enough. Im already suffering   at home....   TL;DR Right now Im looking for help recollecting what to do, how to ease my mind. What do you do to calm yourself? How do you get more grip on yourself?  Thanks in advance...",1553729082,1553729083,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b6bf78/dads_4th_surgery_spending_nights_in_a_hotel/,False,False,0.0
1528,sparks88,1.0,My Reading List,"About a year ago I realized   was taking over my life, day by day my world was growing a bit smaller.  Getting help was among the hardest things Ive done, but Im slowly crawling my way out. One of my core beliefs is that you get out of life what you put in, so I supplemented my therapy with daily meditation and regular reading. I wanted to post my reading list in hopes that maybe some of this could help someone.     **Are u Okay? - Kati Morton**  This is a good book if you are thinking about therapy but dont know where to start or what to expect. I read this after months in therapy, so it sort of covered what I had already learned. It might have helped my   ahead of time ""knowing the rules"", though I would recommend therapy to anyone. You dont have to be sick enough.     **Full Catastrophe Living - Jon Kabat-Zinn**  I liked that the author came at this from a very clinical perspective, which made it easier for me to buy into the whole mindfulness thing. He also has a very unique and intimate relationship with chronic physical pain as it relates to mindfulness.     **The Power of Now - Eckhart Tolle**  This book is the opposite of *Full Catastrophe Living*. It comes at mindfulness from a very emotional and personal perspective. He uses language and systematic approaches that would likely feel very comfortable to a person of faith, but given my personal history miss the mark. I think he says a lot of true things in this book, but I find it hard to hear of my personal biases.     **Mindfulness in Plain English -** **Bhante Henepola Gunarantana**   A bit deceptively titled, this is really a book on vipassana meditation abstracted largely from the Buddhist tradition. My favorite think about this book is that it is not at all quotable. After reading *The Power of Now* I found myself trying to quote Eckhart Tolle during my meditation, which is counter productive. It is a simple book, which seems appropriate since mindfulness is very simple (though not at all easy).     **Daring Greatly - Brene Brown**  Part of beating   is learning to talk about it. This is a great book about learning to have those conversations, and building a better support structure.     **The Mindful Way Through   - Orsillo &amp; Roemer**  I couldnt finish this book because it was too triggering. The vivid descriptions other peoples   was too much for me, though I want to return to it soon as I think it would be good (and safe) practice managing  .     **How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People - Dale Carnegie**  I took a 12 week class on this book in addition to reading it. Both were a waste of time. His advice on stress and worry: decide not to worry! I dont know how I never thought of that!     **The Dresden Files - Jim Butcher**  Dont just be a person who struggles with  . Find joy and love wherever you can.

I used to be a recruiter for a staffing agency and because of the pressure I wanted to find more of an HR generalist job (no sales focus). When I first got my current job I was told that I would need to start with recruiting and I would always be involved with recruiting but I would pick up other responsibilities. Its been almost 2 years and 80% of my job has been all recruiting.   Recently my manager, the person who set those expectations left and I am not being managed. Once he left only 2 things came to mind- 1 find a new job or 2 work harder to get a promotion. Ive been looking for a new job and things have not been going well in my search. The CEO of the company and I do not work well together so its not likely that ill be able to get a promotion.   While all of this has been happening my VP has been in the loop about me being unhappy. Ive been looking for my managers replacement and ive been starting to think maybe I should ride this out maybe ill learn a lot from the new manager. When I expressed my thoughts to the VP she said “if the new manager thinks you have skills to offer maybe she can have you do other things besides recruiting” the way she said it was not rude or with malicious intent but since she said it ive been super anxious. It makes me think she does not think I have any useful skills.  My   is like a wave crashing against a wall going back in forth making me feel pressured and awkward.   How do I just not give a shit about these types of situations?

However, I constantly feel like I don’t deserve to be in the position I’m in, and that one day I’m going to get “found out”, exposed as a fraud, fail my career, whatever.  Like during my undergraduate times, I always had a lot of help from my friends with the coursework/homework problem sheets (which all count towards the overall degree).   I also went abroad to another university as part of my undergraduate degree, where the rules on how they “examined” you were much less strict than back home - things like open book/note tests, and in general I know it was a lot easier, and seemed a lot less legitimate than it did back home - back home you’re expected to memorise equations, aren’t allowed notes, and it’s very clear what is and isn’t allowed in exams for example. So to some extent, compared to my friends back home, I feel like I snaked my way through what would have otherwise been a difficult year back home.  I feel like it’s only a matter of time before I’m exposed for e.g. being a fraud, breaking rules during undergrad etc. Am I being stupid? How can I get over this?

1540,MonocleComplex,1.0,"For those who hang onto their thoughts a little too long: may I recommend to you ""noting"".","So Ive been working with my therapist on my  , and one of the exercises shes been working with me on the most is mindful meditation. I wont say this will automatically cure what ails you, but I found noting to be one of the most effective ways of dealing with extremely stressful situations that I will sometimes obsess over and are constantly distracted by them to the point it affects my health.  **The Noting Technique** is at its core acknowledging your experience without judgement or analysis and assigns a one-word label to whatever youre experiencing. It is very good at grounding you to a situation where you might otherwise usually ride an anxious thought to its fruition.  For an example how it can be used: This last Monday I went to the ER for ongoing pain, and after waiting for the doctor to come back with the results of the CT Scan my husband and I sat in tense silence. After a half hour of sitting there he blurts out with a sigh ""Speculating"".  All of the things his mind is telling him the doctor *might* say, and what the results my scan *might* show can be boiled down to simple speculation for him, and have no basis in reality. He acknowledges them and allows them to be recognized for what they were without having to travel further with these thoughts now that he has given them a name.  I have taken to repeating my ""notes"" until they hold no more meaning to them.  There is probably much more to this particular technique than what I can offer at this point, but for my fellow  -suffers: my therapist has been having me use a meditation app to assist me on working through my   episodes when I am off the clock. I am nowhere near even experienced with meditation and its been about a year, but it has definitely decreased my blood pressure and heart-rate since Ive started practicing their techniques.

I’ve been crying in bed and researching other people’s’ experiences and looking up skin routines and washing my face and comparing my skin now to older pictures of me...and I’m just sick of it.

I dont know if this post goes here, but Im new on Reddit and thought this would be a good place to express what Ive been going through these weeks.  So, the thing goes this way: I recently graduated uni and I feel like I have no purpose and no goals, I just simply feel apathetic and it kinda makes me feel sad cause I see everyone moving forward and working and doing all these things and it makes me feel like Im so stupid to do things or achieve something in life. I dont know what is happening to me but I have a lot   when it comes to try something new and, most recently, getting out there in the professional life and getting a job, and I think this feeling is keeping me from doing those things. I already got a job but quit after 9 months  cause I kind of hated it and the payment was pretty bad. Then, I started working with a friend, got some money, but it doesnt feel like a real job cause its like an spontaneous job, which is making me useless and incapable to do things and being an adult. Also, the situation in my country in term of economy is terrible, thats why Ive thought about going somewhere else but Im scared to do it cause I dont know hows gonna be for me out there, if Ill do well or if Im gonna get a job.  Lately Ive been wondering about my future (Im 23) and It scares me so much that I wont be self sufficient and actually have a purpose and make money. As I said, every time I start looking for a job, I feel dumb and useless cause I see all these requirements asking for all these skills that I think I dont have and then I feel sad and anxious again. Its like a cycle I cannot brake and it makes me furious and sad about myself cause I cant get it done and makes me feel insecure about my future. Ive been studying and learning things I like in the meantime, but it kind of feels like Im avoiding reality.   There are some good thoughts sometimes, they make me feel like I can actually do things and very positive things, but then I overthink and put unnecessary thoughts in my mind and then feel incapable to do anything again.   So, yeah, thats my mind now and I was wondering if some of you are experiencing the same atm or if you did in the past and would like to know how you dealt with it or if you have any advice.

After my second, I got to a really good place for about two years. Came off the meds and everything. At one point, I had to face my wife and son traveling away from me for a week, the next week I was to catch up with them overseas (on the same flight which I had a traumatic experience on a few years prior), a dissertation to complete and defend, and a job to find.   That all happened at once.   returned with a vengeance. Back on one of the meds and back in therapy. That did make things somewhat better. However, my family left ahead of me--not the end of the world after all. I met up with them--a peaceful flight! We came home, back to normal. I wrote my dissertation--what a relief! I defended my dissertation--that wasnt so scary, and people are giving me gifts and calling me Dr! Neat!  And yet as I shed these emotional triggers, Im not seeing the healing I expected. The night after I defended my dissertation, I went into a thought racing tailspin and had a panic attack. This week Ive have panic attacks two days in a row. In some ways I feel worse, as Ive shed every situational trigger except finding a job.   My GP and psychologist all agreed that I just had so much on my plate. Enough to make someone without   crumble. So of course it would hurt someone with heightened sensitivities. So why am I feeling worse immediately following my dissertation?   I have a few thoughts. The weeks leading up to it, I was EXTREMELY stressed. Late nights, early mornings, lots of uncertainty. Maybe that ""scarred"" the mind and its not going to heal right away. Like if someone stops punching me in the face, that immediate pain stops, but Im going to be bruised for a few weeks. But ultimately, I will get better after shedding this weight.

One night, a couple are taking an order at the front and another man walks in and beats this man orderings head in multiple times until he was unconscious and then kicked his head in and got away. He died 10 days later and I was pretty shaken up from it. I live a pretty sheltered life, I know I live in a rough town but I never witness stuff like this.  When I saw that guy bashing the other guy in the head with the stick I thought oh my god, its happening again, hes gonna kill him  I was talking to my friend at the time and he wondered if I had questions about something and I said sorry and explained what just happened and Id have to get back to him.  I legitimately sounded confused as to why I mentioned it or why itd effect me at all and I just felt so stupid, I realised my feelings were invalid and I overreacted again.

Ive always held my pen weird but it doesnt affect my writing at all.  me, crying: this is how I write  dad: no it isnt. write normally  just wanting to be out of this situation, i do what he says and i hold my pen the normal way and write my name. it looks shit    dad: that looks like a fucking 2 year old wrote that  obviously it does you fucking moronic piece of shit  we were in a public place with probably near 30 - 40 people in it. no shame.  later when were out of that place he tries to talk to me and act like nothing happened, no apology, nothing. i again, try to tell him that Ive always written that way but he tells me that IM WRONG. ME, THE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN ME FOR 14 YEARS, KNOWS LESS ABOUT ME THAN HE DOES. he just tells me hes never seen me write like that  which tbh just shows he couldnt give less of a shit about my life.  he and my mum have started telling me that he has   too (social) and thats why he shouted in a public place at me to write like a normal person??? i get that people with   react differently to different situations but thats pure bullshit. your first choice would not be to draw 200% more attention to yourself   TL:DR. dad trips me up, shouts at me to write like a normal person in public, both parents claim that he has  , clearly does not. question: abuse or am i just dramatic as shit??",1553720463,1553720464,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b69p35/is_this_abuse_or_am_i_dramatic/,False,False,0.0

1566,safeuniverse,1.0,How to deal with anxiety triggered by others' anxiety,"It happens to me that when Im on my own Im pretty cool, but when Im with specific people I get very anxious by watching them become anxious.    Especially my mom, who was diagnosed with   and depression some years ago (this deserves another post). She is very anxious the whole day, to the point she doesnt stop talking and it triggers my   to the highest. I dont see her until its the evening because its when I come back from work. She makes me talk also (when I dont feel like talking), gets angry if I just wanna eat and go to my bedroom to read or watch a tv show, and says something like ""I havent seen you the whole day"" which for me is very stressing because she lives with me, she sees me every day.    The problem is when she talks either she thinks loud (I mean she starts saying EVERYTHING SHE THINKS, or everything she writes - e.g she is texting and says the words as she texts), or she talks to me about some things I have to do. For example if I was going to decide whether I should go on vacation to X or Y place, and there is a lot of time remaining to decide that, she asks me about that every day and starts saying ""and what are you going to do with that? have you decided yet? because you should think how much money youll need and \[...\]"". I always reply that theres no need on deciding now, that I have time. And she decides to ignore that and asks again the next day.    So I think Im always fine, until its the evening and I feel tortured by these questions. Also sometimes I get triggered when she jumps out of the chair when she hears a loud noise. E.g I drop something that makes a loud noise and she jumps out and asks me what I had dropped. Both things make me anxious, her jumping out and her asking about what I had dropped (because I feel when Im alone I just ignore I dropped something, and I dont get angry. If she asks I feel I have the need to recognize I dropped something, and I get very angry because I usually get mad when I drop things. I have a lot of anger issues).    I also get anxious when I see that my dog is anxious. E.g with loud sounds, or when she gets scared because of a sudden movement I make.   I really dont know how to deal with this. I mean, its not that my   is non-existent when Im alone, but it gets a lot worse when Im surrounded by beings who get anxious.

1568,StillLost86,1.0,"Was she being callous/mean here, or was my intense anxiety actually at fault?","Hi, everyone. I get upset and anxious thinking about this situation. The whole thing has left me with a lot to process and questioning how much of a role my   played in it. Any advice/opinions/insight would be much appreciated. Sorry about the length.   Some background: I met a married woman on Reddit eighteen months ago, helped her have an affair because she told me all the ways her husband was an insensitive, emotionally neglectful ass and I foolishly believed her to be righteous (I acknowledge this was a major error in judgment on my part; I was blinded by desire and loneliness). We had met in person twice already at the time of this event and believed we were basically soulmates. Were not together anymore (she separated from her husband and walked away from me for another Reddit dude due to my mental illness, or so she says), but Ive been told there are things ""red flaggy"" about her behavior in this specific situation, so Im trying to field more input as to whether Im completely at fault here or if she was being mean.  Back in September, she had asked me what I thought about moving down there to be with her. This was before she had even discussed separation with her husband, and after only two in person meetings. We had known each other for a year at this point. I wanted desperately to say yes, because I was madly in love with her, but my   was triggered and flared up big time, so my initial response was to refuse (she was aware of my mental illness history, and she has one of her own). Ive lived here my entire life and became so terrified at the idea of leaving all I knew, which was amplified by the  . I wanted it, but something internal was keeping me from it.  I knew I was wrong to say no, so I spent weeks forcing my way past the   and made myself change my mind despite it. About three weeks after the first conversation, and after I had indicated that I was working on saying yes despite the intense fear, she sent me this e-mail:  ""Ive been thinking...why do I pine over our relationship when you wont even make a leap of faith for our relationship? Its certainly given me a lot of think over. I think this will be my last email for tonight. Maybe even for a while. Im not mad. Just thinking like...whats the point?  I responded that I was sorry, that I couldnt just drop everything without a stable plan in place, that my answer was now yes, but we needed to discuss in depth and determine whether or not it was realistically feasible.  Her response: ""A yes through pursed lips isnt exactly what I was looking for.""  I called her out for seeming to be insulted my initial answer had been no after all the explaining I had been doing as to why it had been no, and how she was aware of my extreme fears and anxieties over the idea that were no reflection of how I actually felt about her or the idea.  Her response: ""I am insulted, because...well, the world doesnt revolve around your fears and anxieties. Sometimes you have to do shit and get shit done regardless of your fears.""  I begged her to let me call her and talk it out. We did, and things soon calmed down as we discussed elements and issues related to my anxieties. We actually left that conversation in a good place. She had stopped taking her bipolar meds about this time, claiming they never worked, and attempted suicide five days later, which led to her hospitalization a couple days after that. I do not believe this to be a response to our disagreement.  Her last statement in that e-mail is the point of contention here. Was she being callous and cruel and selfish, despite struggling with mental illness herself and despite knowing how strong my fears were, or was I completely in the wrong and she was righteous, or was it something else?   tl;dr: After a year of knowing each other and two in person meetings, she asked me to move to her state before even talking to her husband about separation. We both have histories of mental illness, I said no out of terror of leaving my lifelong home but busted my mental ass to change my answer because I did actually want it, she became insulted and hurt and basically told me to get over my  .

1596,Sagittariahx,1.0,I can't stop worrying that I'll die (Health Anxiety),"I have been stuck into this vicious circle for a couple of months now (even though roughly a year ago, 2 years ago and 4 years ago, I was experiencing similar thoughts and worries)  I will be talking about my most recent episode. It started with mild symptoms in my breast, a tiny discharge (from both). That was it, that triggered it all.   I rushed and made a doctor appointment. I worried I might have breast cancer, I cried to my mom, I asked her countless times if anyone ever had breast cancer in the family, the answer is no. While waiting for my appointment, I started getting more and more anxious. I had blurry vision and bouts of vertigo whenever I was thinking about it.    One night I had a bad episode of vertigo followed by racing heart. I immediately go to the ER, spent a night there, done x rays, EKG and some neurological tests, all was good.  Doctors diagnosis:  .   My appointment comes, my breasts are fine, no signs of constant discharge, no lumps, no abnormalities. I also had to go through my yearly gynecological exam the same day and so I did, all good until an ultrasound revealed a small healing cyst (thats how my doctor described it) Looked as if it bled at one point and then started to heal, he said that I might have had a small cyst a couple of months ago that ruptured, since it was small it caused no symptoms, another one of his theory is that I ovulated while I was on pill. He said all is good, no follow up until next year.   I got home and cried. Started worrying I had ovarian cancer. Brought up my medical books and started desperately reading about everything, avoided google as much as I could because I know how bad it is to go down that rabbit hole. Eventually I convinced myself with the help of my mom that I am fine.    I had a very stressful exam coming (the SAT) so I was spending most of my time obsessing with it. I had to travel to another city to take it, and so I did. After I returned, new symptom: muscle twitching.   Ironically I was also starting to study for a uni admission that had to do with healthcare, 3 subjects in particular: muscles, bones and nerves, so my mind was fresh with MS and ALS. I wasnt surprised at all when I started obsessing over these both, ALS in particular. The more I read on these 3 chapters, the more symptoms I get, symptoms of God knows what bone cancer or neurological disorder or anything I read really. I find myself testing my reflexes multiple times a day, touching my legs, doing certain exercises to check for muscle weakness, going into panic at every little pain I have anywhere in my body.   My mom suggested I stop studying for this exam (since I already got accepted into one uni and currently waiting for answer from another) and just relax until the school year starts. I will also talk about this to my counselor on Friday.    Deep down I know the stress &amp;   is causing my body to have certain reactions, and that these reactions are triggering more stress &amp;  .... but somehow I still have the impression that I have x and y diseases and that I will die.    Anyone else experiencing health  ?

Recovery teaches us that we have a disease and that we should not be ashamed of having it. Recovery teaches us it is not our fault that we have this disease. We are not losers; we are not evil; we are not weak willed. It is wrong and harmful for us to beat up on ourselves because we have this disease. It is even wrong and harmful for us to beat ourselves up for suffering the consequences of this disease. It is wrong and harmful for us to continually blame ourselves for the harm we have done others and because we make mistakes. We must use gentle encouraging words when we talk to ourselves as we slowly progress in recovery. We must learn to be on our own side.  The app is called SoberTool if anyone is interested.

1624,missymooo18,1.0,Would this job be worth it or not.....,"Okay, so this is going to be a little long because I dont know how else to explain my situation without background info. So thank you in advance if you take the time to read and help!  So my boyfriend and I moved to this city far away from home, because my friend who moved here first, referred me to a job here. My boyfriend came here not having a job, and as you can imagine it was NOT an easy transition for him. He isolated himself, and cut himself off from anything social I invited him to. We explored together on the weekends at first, but then it turned to every weekend being very negative and tons of fighting. He complained about hating it here and wanting to move back home. I said he wasnt giving it a chance because its a great place. I really tried to help him but he became soooo negative, and I just started to form a life outside of him, including my one childhood best friend. Her and I spent a lot of time together, and we liked to go out and drink together. My boyfriend would always text me negative things and stress me out, and my friend picked up on it. He started to resent my friend and hate her, and she picked up on that too. Before you know it, they hated each other. Oh boy. It was a mess and a lot of drama and I wont go into it more than that.   Ive been friends with this girl since childhood, so, as you can imagine its hard to stay friends with someone for so long because we still see each other as the younger version of ourselves. She became frustrated with my boyfriend situation and my constant complaining about him without breaking up with him. Which I get can be frustrating but also.. it’s very complicated.   This friend and I had a falling out, largely driven by my relationship. This happened right as the office where we worked closed. I stopped seeing her completely and was jobless for a little and had a lot of time for my boyfriend. Our relationship improved bc their was less jealousy but I really had no life and zero friends. So seems our relationship is better when my life is worse? But also he is a lot more settled here with his job and his friends. I got a job but it doesnt pay that well or have much growth opportunities, but i dont have the mooost experience so its something for now.   Fast forward a few months (now), this friend reached out to me to tell me her company is hiring. The position would be more money and pto/ holidays than my current job. Also the option to work remotely a couple days a week. Not a dramatic amount more, but more money nonetheless which is an important factor. This field is just all about connections and who you know.   Ideally, I dont want to work with this friend again but if I got the job it does NOT mean we have to be super close, I will have a wall up and still be independent. My boyfriend said if I take the job, he will be really angry because when I worked with her before it was the ""worst year of his life""   I think hes being irrational and selfish. Im not going to all the sudden disappear and become bffs with this girl again. I’ve learned a lot past few months and will have a wall up unlike before. But even so Im afraid he would text me all the time making his negative comments and fight with me and itll be absolute hell and not worth the money/PTO/remote working.  Ugh.

As well, it sometimes continues outside work:   My head will keep spinning and I will essentially drag myself into a loop where I think that I will never be able to get rid of those   attacks and I am destined to be a failure. It gets to a point where I have a hard time to formulate my thoughts and to keep track of what is the actual trigger.  It is not always that I feel anxious from work, sometimes I feel rewarded and sometimes ambivalent. Therefore, I do not  not think that changing my field will lead to solving my   issues.  Therefore, I am looking for techniques to help my head to stop spinning/panicking whenever I am in anxious situation or after an anxious situation. With some restrictions (that I feel are anyways not applicable):  1. I dont feel like I can talk about any of that with my friends or my partner. I dont want to become a nuisance and I dont want to be needy. I feel like not whining about   in front of my friends is the only thing I can be proud of. 2. I have a shrink that I see once in a while. It is funded by my workplace and therefore it may take time to receive an appointment. Hence, it cannot help me immediately. 3. Writing to you did help a bit (right now), but I cannot open a thread whenever I have a panic attack ;) 4. As I said, I will not change my workplace for now.

I was doing a lot better after a while so I was discharged from the therapy. Unfortunately Ive pretty much crashed again. Not quite suicidal but still incredibly uncomfortable and it makes living a complete chore :(  I used to work at a swimming pool as a lifeguard/cleaner person. As cliche as it sounds the most beautiful girl with the sweetest personality started talking to me and after a while I asked her out and weve been in an exclusive relationship for about 8 months now. However, from the start Ive NEVER been able to be myself around her. Im always really tense, mumble or stutter, just generally a weird guy around her. She said its cute but that shed love me no matter how awkward or confident I was.  I got fired a couple months ago for things, mainly because I made out with said girlfriend at the swimming pool (not while working of course, we were both there to swim as customers) but of course thats incredibly unprofessional to do at my workplace regardless of whether or not Im working. So I got fired which really sucked and plummeted my self-esteem, I started wondering what people thought of me, how everyone must hate me for that, how strange they must think I am, that I must have forced my gf into it (I didnt), etc. etc. and that destroys me too. I spoke to one of my coworkers about it and he was like yeah, not gonna lie most people didnt like you, so my literal worst fear was apparently true.  My girlfriend managed to talk me out of beating myself up too hard over it, but it still upsets me a lot. Ive been told I could re-apply for the job and have a second chance in a few months but the comment that people didnt like me still hurts me way worse than being fired itself.

Hello everyone after lurking for some time and reading all your fights and battles I would like to share my own and ask for some advice.  I am adult bio-male but have always been interested in more ""Feminine"" things from feelings to interested and at early age this was never a problem.  At around my early teenage years it was also never an issue I would talk about anything from make-up to fashion and share my feelings with my mostly female friend group.  Sadly, after finishing that part of my education I switched to a new school to follow my career path but by doing this I lost contact with my old friend group.  I feel more and more alone and trapped, of course I have some classroom friends that I talk too but only in school and the 2/3 friends I have left from other school are busy with their life what is of course totally understandable, and I don’t blame them for anything.  So, I just talk about only general things and keep lot to myself what leads to sometimes just days of me feeling alone or not understood.  This more “feminine” behaviour and interested feel really like my true self (If that makes sense?). I feel happy when I can do it and can talk about it.   But more and more I feel I am not born in the right ""body"" and of course after doing self-research like anyone does this days ""Gender-dysphoria"" came quickly on top of all my research.  But I quickly pushed it aside because in my mind I am not so far that I hate everything about my body and I can’t life as a male, so I focused my attention on trying to sneakily buy more ""feminine"" clothing and mixing it with my style and wear things that I could justify easily.  This works a bit and I feel much more comfortable when I wear it and do things I really like. But it still leaves a lot of things that I really want like a more “feminine” body, long hair, wearing more female style on daily basis that are not possible in my current environment.   I already planned about when I move out and live on my own to change a lot of things from my room style to the way I dress because my family wouldn’t judge me and most “friends” would not be around. But this plan sounds more like hiding my true self then a solution. But this plan is really what keeps me going and I can’t wait to just buy clothing and decorate my rooms how I like.   So, I want to ask you people for some advice, what can help me with figuring out what I want, and should I take the “Gender-dysphoria” possibility more serious?      Thanks for reading this wall of text and much love to this wonderful subreddit &lt;3  (Side note: Family is not hateful to me and lets me do almost anything but still I feel a line I can’t cross and the ways they joke about me being “gay” doesn’t help to cross this line and just see how they respond)",1553696965,1553696965,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b654zj/the_fight_who_is_me/,False,False,0.0

I got fired a couple months ago for things, mainly because I made out with said girlfriend at the swimming pool (not while working of course, we were both there to swim as customers) but of course thats incredibly unprofessional to do at my workplace regardless of whether or not Im working. So I got fired which really sucked and plummeted my self-esteem, I started wondering what people thought of me, how everyone must hate me for that, how strange they must think I am, that I must have forced my gf into it (I didnt), etc. etc. and that destroys me too. I spoke to one of my coworkers about it and he was like yeah, not gonna lie most people didnt like you, so my literal worst fear was apparently true.  My girlfriend managed to talk me out of beating myself up too hard over it, but it still upsets me a lot. Ive been told I could re-apply for the job and have a second chance in a few months but the comment that people didnt like me still hurts me way worse than being fired itself.  So I realised I wanted to make myself a better person. Someone likeable. Liked by EVERYONE. Theres this guy at my work who everyone used to love, he was just all around a great guy and I wanted peoples perception of me to be like that too. I dont even know why. It isnt healthy for me to spend every living moment longing to be like that, but for whatever reason I do and I cant help it.  So Ive narrowed my current depression down to two things:  * I want everyone to like me. (Not literally, but the same way everyone liked Steven Hawking for example.) I know this isnt possible, but I still NEED it somehow. * I want to be myself around my girlfriend. I cant be around her without feeling out of my skin. She doesnt mind but its a horrible feeling and it gets so exhausting.  I would be so so so so so so so so so helpful if anyone could help me with this. thank you.

I went to do my masters and was happy at first but now I’m having second thoughts, especially because I paid quite a bit for my degree and realised I could have been smarter about my choices. My therapist reminds me that a mistake is something we do when we KNOW it’s a wrong decision at the time, not when it’s something we use all our resources to gather and chose what we think is best at the time. I’d like to think of it this way, but sometimes when   takes over I can’t stop focusing on the regret. Anybody else feel similar?

(I do take Xannax on a as needed basis, this was a an needed experience)    Im that crazy cat lady. I have 3 furbabies who are my world. Weve been struggling to get rid of some fleas that my only indoor/outdoor cat bright in (all 3 are on topical flea meds, but he still managed to catch them and spread them) So as a last resort I got the trio some flea collars. I dont like them since they arent break away, but I was at my wits end. All had been fine since Saturday when I got them.   Yesterday I came home from work to my worst nightmare. I had heard horror stories but never thought it would happen to my own cat. We found blood on the tile throughout the house. My instinct told me, find the kitten (hes about 6 months). Sure enough, he had gotten his collar lose enough to get his jaw caught. I was freaking out but I managed to free him. He was still covered in blood and I was terrified he had dislocated or broken his jaw. We had left at 6am for work and it was now 4:30pm. Who knows how long he had been stuck like that.   At this point Im a mess, complete panic attack. Thankfully my boyfriend is level headed and over the course of our relationship has come to understand and identify my   attacks. He is the real MVP as he helped get me and the little one to the car and on our way to the vet without causing additional stress on either of us.   Thankfully my kitten is okay. The blood was from biting his tongue and scratching his nose (likely while trying to get the collar unstuck) He was dehydrated, and had some inflammation in his gums from the chemicals in the collar, but will be fine. Needless to say, no more collar for him.  The logical side of my brain is telling me its not my fault, I did everything I could to make sure he was okay after the trauma. That after 30 years of owning cats, this being the first incident like this, thats pretty good.   The   side of my brain is still in worst case scenario mode. Its my fault. I put the collar on him. It could have been worse. Im a terrible cat mom.   I know it seems silly, because its a cat, but since I dont have kids, my cats are my kids.

Like, I could talk or say anything with my best friend, but with a random, that cute girl Ive known for years, or even some family members, my mind will process things so much that I say either nothing, or something I know I normally wouldnt say (instead of a joke, Ill give a basic, not funny answer). It takes me constant contact with someone in order to break out my shell. And, I guess this stems from my lack of confidence, which I began noticing in middle school. I dont understand why I lack confidence because Im no longer bad looking, nor am I dumb or unexciting. Im also confident in my ability to get things done, but my mind just isnt up to par yet. I simply cant think of things to say in certain situations which hinders me greatly.  This will make me depressed, and Ill sit and loathe by myself. Maybe even smoke a joint while Im at it.   I dont want to sound cocky or anything, but everybody I come in contact with tends to like me, and it baffles me because I could say little to nothing (Ex. My friends uncle said Im like a son to him, yet he doesnt remember his nephews name). But, most of these people are introduced to me by someone else.

1647,NobleAda,1.0,I can't help but feel like I ruined a friendship,"To start, Ive been having a bit of a rough week. There are a lot of huge changes on the horizon in my life, and I just started seeing a therapist to help me with my coping skills, which are basically nonexistent at the moment. Ive been on the verge of an attack for several days, but Ive been trying to keep it at bay with some of the tools my counselor taught me about during my last session, but I dont think theyre really working.  Fast forward to yesterday. I was at the tail end of a particularly stressful couple of days at work, and a friend of mine messaged me, asking how my therapy was going. I told her a bit about what we talked about and that our next session would broach a particularly difficult topic, and I was incredibly anxious about it. Now, this is a subject shes familiar with, as shes told be about her experiences with it, and I suddenly felt as if Id somehow made it seem like I was saying my experience was somehow worse than hers (in retrospect, I dont think what I said even comes close to conveying that), and it caused me to spiral into a particularly intense bout of self doubt and loathing.   I tried so hard to save face and back pedal, explaining what I meant about it while trying to assure her that her feelings and experiences are valid. Over the course of an hour or so, I sent her a wall of texts trying to justify my earlier assertion until finally, I just said ""Im so sorry about all of this."" She never responded.  To be honest, I dont blame her. Shes been going through a lot recently, and I feel so selfish for having unloaded all of these feelings on her. After I got home from work and an evening meeting I had to attend, I just kind of isolated myself. It wasnt until right before bed, when my boyfriend came upstairs and asked what was wrong that I snapped and just let it all out. I felt a little better, but I still feel like garbage now. My friend still hasnt said anything, despite having seen the messages yesterday (I hate that it tells you when people have read your messages). I cant help but feel like Ive made a fool of myself and that shell never want to talk to me again, and Im afraid to reach out to her so soon. However, I cant help but feel like if I dont, Im going to have this sour feeling in the pit of my stomach.

Things are going pretty well professionally for me, but my personal life is really off.  I havent made any new friends since I left the Navy 5 years ago. I have been in one relationship in the past 6 years, but it was only a few months. I dont go to social events to meet people. I just stand in the back and dont talk to people. I just have this constant mindset that they wouldnt be interested to talk to me. Even worse, I have friends I have known for years. We will make plans to do something, but after I do, I instantly regret it. For example, I am planning a trip out of the country and invited two of my friends because I didnt want to go alone. However, I was expecting them to both decline, but when they seemed interested, I started wishing I hadnt invited them. It has nothing to do with them either. I want to date as well, but its really hard to meet people when I feel this way. I try online dating, but I keep giving myself internal reasons why the people I do get in contact with wont be worth it. When I do manage to actually contact someone and arrange a meeting, I basically shut down, and offer barely anything in conversation, even though I am interested. I will want to ask a question, but I have to ask it over and over again in my head to make sure it sounds right, and by then its too late to ask. The people I meet seem to think I am boring or not interested. I dont have issues being in public, it just comes to situations where there is one on one contact with strangers. I keep thinking of going to the Dr or a therapist, but I have heard some horror stories about medications making people worse, and with my current job I dont think I can risk it. I used to just live with it and just toss it up to introversion, and for a long time I was at peace with being alone, but now that I am a bit older, my feelings on it have changed. I also feel like I used to not have any real emotion on any spectrum, but that seems to be shifting as well. I feel dumb turning to strangers on the internet for this, but dont think its a conversation I can have with family or friends. Guess I am looking for some unbiased, independent counsel.

Boyfriend (34m) is wonderful but is also divorced, married for 10 years before leaving due to his ex cheating. Nasty situation and divorce, she was a typical liar/manipulator/cheater type. I saw the proof and know him well enough to know he’s telling the truth.   We started dating when he was separated and after all the drama ended. He had dated plenty of women between separation and dating me. We’ve been together over 10 months but were coworkers for 4 years before he left.    I (32f) know he’s been completely faithful. He tells me how much he loves me in detail and always shows me in actions/gestures/quality time together. We are long distance but spend a lot of our free time on FaceTime together. He plans his future around me and always includes me in planning anything, down to making sure I helped choose his new mattress as it would be ‘ours’ in the future.   I think because the marriage was 10 years long, my   and paranoia flare up about him still caring for her. I feel... jealous? even though he reassures me all the time and tries to help me even though I am anxious. I have been through trauma and depression and he is very understanding. I don’t trust anyone, I’ve always been a loner although I do have some great friends. He’s probably the person I trust the most... he was very sad when I told him I don’t trust him completely, but I do trust him “99%”. He says I’m his best friend who has his complete 100% trust, and not in a creepy way but very sincere way.   I don’t know why I get like this. I just don’t want this ruining my relationship.

On the one hand, I know I have a good chance because I’m very quick and efficient, I keep a clean work space all the time, and I give the best customer service I possibly can.

I have been in some major accidents which has caused my   to worsen. I’m okay being a passenger in the car but as soon as we get on the freeway or a highway, I instantly become panicked. In the past couple of months I have been using some coping mechanisms to help me feel less panicked, but sometimes I can’t help it.  In 2017 I was able to get my first car which helped me move out with my ex and gain some more independence. The car worked great and at first, driving on the freeway was extremely hard for me to do, but it gradually faded and I didn’t mind it too much. In 2018 I moved out of my ex’s house and into an apartment with my friend and my car was still acting great. However during the summer my car randomly broke down in the middle of the intersection. We would try and fix it but it ended up breaking down a couple more times before it was completely dead. Because of this, my   has grown severe around cars and I can’t bring myself to buy a new one.  So far things have been okay. I take the bus or train to the places I needed to be, or walked if that option wasn’t available. I don’t ask for rides unless someone offers, and I feel as if walking more has helped me be a little more healthy and helps me feel more calm instead of anxious. I can tell my significant other is annoyed with me not having a car... but no matter how much I try and explain it to her, I still feels like she doesn’t understand. We live in a city where I can get anywhere by walking or by bus so I don’t feel as if it’s a problem. I don’t feel ready to have a car yet. Again, I don’t ask my significant other for rides unless she offers.  As of tomorrow I will start taking a medication (I can’t remember what it’s called) and I feel like it will not only help me feel less anxious, but also help me work on my coping mechanisms. I think with time I will be able to get a new car and have more independence, but right now I don’t feel ready.  So I’m looking for advice. I need help finding a coping mechanism that works for me but I’m having a hard time with that. Is there something that has been very helpful for you?

I also worry about things that I can never hope to control. I worry about what other people think and feel. If they’re happy, satisfied, and feel good about themselves. Most importantly though I worry about what I mean to other people. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t think about that for every single person I meet. That would be far too much for me to handle.   No, I worry about what I mean to the people who mean the most to me. A lot of that stems from this problem I have of heavily investing my emotions into people from an early stage, but that’s simply because I feel like my sense of character is usually right. I feel like I can trust too soon, reveal too much too early, and share pieces of me that I tend to keep hidden. There’s some cases where I can catch this and stop it but not always. It’s a trap that I fall into and coming back out is a painful process. One that involves cutting off a piece of me in order to escape, and it takes a lot to get that piece back. Lots of nights questioning my self-worth and rebuilding myself piece by piece until I feel whole again; only to thrust myself right back into that exact same situation. It’s not something that I want to do but something that just happens. It seems like the trap is always triggered by the smallest thing. A simple text that maybe I just read wrong. Cancellation of plans that I was really looking forward to. A lack of reciprocation in things that I say and do. As soon as one of these happens my mind always goes to the worst case scenario of what did I do wrong or should I have held back a little bit longer to see if maybe…just maybe they would’ve fallen into that same trap.   I guess a lot of that stems back to how I was raised. My mother abused me. Little things triggered her too. Like how if the baseboards weren’t dust-free by the time we got finished she would scream and yell as if we had just burned her wedding dress. Over the course of my young life my sense of worth was gradually worn down by a grinding stone that never seemed to stop. When I was little it was simply her yelling at me until I cried. As I got older I was shoved into just about everything inside and outside our house, walls, the stove, the ground. Once she even whipped me with an extension cord. Now don’t get me wrong she would apologize. She would come and sing me to sleep, but first she would say how sorry she was for everything she did that day. She promised to never do it again and that she would try harder to hold her anger in check. For a while I believed these promises. I needed to believe these promises because after all, she’s my mother. However, years of this constant cycle of being built up and torn back down destroyed my sense of worth and trust for what people said.   I experienced first-hand how the things that people say mean nothing compared to what they do, and now all I see is what people are able to do for me. It’s those cancellations of plans after the excitement of looking forward to them that kills my confidence in their appreciation of me. No matter their reason, all I see is the fact that they aren’t going to deliver on their promise. Then comes the overthinking. I’m afraid that those plans only meant something to me and our spending time together was merely something that happened to be convenient for them. I am not someone that they need to go out of their way to make time for, but rather, an item to be picked up and played with for a little while until they become bored and move on to something more interesting. I’m sorry I’m not more interesting I really wish I was. I’m not charming, I don’t have this natural sense of charisma that draws other people in and holds them there, captivated. I can’t make people double over with laughter after a quick witted joke. Instead, I have a mind of random facts that are literally useless in everyday life. However, under that there is a part of me that has deep thoughts about topics that matter. Things that, hopefully, will make people stop and think. I’m just afraid I’ll never keep anyone interested long enough for them to hear those thoughts. I worry…a lot. I’m just worried I’ll never figure out how to stop.

I have this gut wrenching fear of losing my mom, sometimes I can go weeks or months feeling from but as if flicking a switch I flip. I cant sleep for days at a time just thinking about the thought of losing my mom, all these ways I could possibly loose her.   Im not religious but in these bouts of crying Im literally praying for there to be a heaven so I would be able to see her again if she passed. This fear I know is a bit irrational and makes me paranoid and afraid but it just wont go away for days when it shows up. Ive mentioned it to maybe a few people before but they all tell me not to freak out about it, to live in the moment.   I cant just live in the moment, I honest to God cant mentally handle the thought of losing my mom. I love her, more than I love anyone. I grew up in a two parent household but my dad was always an asshole, my mom is my sole parent in my eyes. What makes my fear and   worse and I am the baby of my family and technically an accident, my mom had me when she was early 30s. I spend days praying shell be healthy and live long like most of the females in her family. But whenever she tells me about like her aunt dying or something I feel myself crying inside out of fear.   I still live with my parents and I love living with my mom, shes such a part of my everyday life. She may not know it but shes like my best friend. Ive never told her my fears because as much as I love her I ironically have trouble expressing emotions. Ive always had trouble getting emotions out there, even hugging. It has led to me bottling things up and internally exploding at times.   She gets mad at me because I take away her phone while shes driving. After one winter a few years ago her car slid on the ice while driving. Even though she wasnt on the phone its made me paranoid of her while driving.   I wish more than anything I could get high paying job and just set her up for life. Make sure she always has the medicine she needs, doesnt have to work her stupid current job that makes her lift heavy things, buy her anything she wanted, etc. I just want her to be safe...and these random bouts of paranoia and   are making me shutdown for days at a time. And the fact I struggle so hard with showing my emotions is making it worse, I dont know why I cant Express my emotions right and it makes me angry at myself...

1724,nixienoodlebeeb,1.0,Making Decisions,"How do you do it? I never learned and therapy isn’t helping. I get so overwhelmed I can’t ever choose anything and I am tired of letting life just happen to me. Right now I am putting money aside as much as I can (which isn’t much) to try to move, but I don’t know where to move to or what to do when I get there. I don’t know how to find a job, how to even decide what to apply for or where. I hate what I do now, but I don’t know how to choose something different, let alone how to obtain new qualifications or look for jobs in a new field. I only have the job I have now because someone else applied for it for me. They picked out my apartment too. I don’t know how to do any of that! And I am in my 30s, so it’s especially fucking sad how incapable I am of running my own life or making any choices.   I am also faced now with having to make a decision, I can afford to either A. get a car to try to give myself some more independence and freedom than I currently have and make it easier to potentially find a new job and/or move. B. get started on fixing my teeth which are BAD (childhood neglect/abuse combined with fear of the dentist and shame) and cause me a whole lot of pain/insecurity and keep me from feeling able to even think about dating or moving on from my divorce or C. move out of my apartment either to a different (more convenient to my current job) one in my area or to a new area if I can find a new job. I don’t feel capable of making this huge decision, let alone all the smaller decisions inherent in each one.   No one will help me or give me advice. I don’t know how to find the best ways to go about any of these things. If I decided to start with my teeth I can’t afford all the work I would need done so that would only be a stop gap, I’m not sure that with my   I’m actually capable of driving so that could be a total waste. I have no reason to move anywhere other than I don’t like where I am, so I don’t even have the slightest clue where I would go. I don’t know what to do. All of these decisions also kind of feed into each other, having a car would make changing jobs easier, changing jobs could make getting the dental work done easier. If I could drive I could make it to dental appointments easier and possibly take on a second job to help pay for the work. If I had my teeth done maybe I would feel more confident when looking for new jobs, etc etc. It feels like I need all 3 things to happen to start living my life and I feel a lot of pressure to not keep just waiting for life to start since I am a little older and I have just been on pause since my divorce.   How do people make decisions, how do you sort this all out? I have to make a list on Sunday of what I’m going to wear to work all week because otherwise the options are too daunting in the morning and I feel overwhelmed by it and run late and then hate whatever I picked out and feel insecure in it all day.

Exercise, healthy diet, meditation, medication, therapy. I feel like Im doing everything ""right"" but nothing helps.      Im thankful that my boss is willing to help me out and not just fire me. Hes a really nice guy but at the same time he has no clue what its like to deal with mental health issues (he told me this).

If you are a regular sufferer of panic attacks like me, I find that identifying my physical symptoms or my intrusive thoughts each time I get them during the panic attacks makes me feel a lot better because my brain starts to slowly recognize these symptoms and thoughts as not dangerous and completely irrational. If you always feel the same symptoms during high   periods or feel all kinds of   symptoms, just know that with discipline and determination you can end a panic attack a lot faster by recognizing the reoccurring symptoms you get during an episode and not reacting to them. This is obviously a lot easier said than done but speaking from experience,  I found that giving up the internet for a few weeks and getting daily exercise helped a lot. It’s hard for people to even realize that they are in a rut  but the fact of the matter is that 2 weeks can go by so quickly when you are anxious and depressed all the time and you don’t even realize it. I know it can be hard to bounce back to your old self, but just know that there is someone in your shoes right now battling the same thing as you. I just want to give some motivation to people out there suffering everyday like myself because there is hope. I can happily say that with short term medication use and a will to want to improve myself I am living a lot happier than I was 4 months ago.

I am a 20 year old male who just experienced his 3rd   relapse of his life. My first was in the summer of 2016 after getting a bad   attack from going to a college orientation. The second time was in the summer of 2018  after I had to move out of my home due to a house flood. The third time was literally this weekend.   It wasnt as bad as the other 2 times but it sure felt like it was gonna be. The world felt scary. My room didnt feel safe. Everything felt so unfamiliar, so foreign. Parents (I live with my parents) seemed like strangers, food was not enjoyable, bed was not comfortable, I didnt even want to sit down...I was just so scared of everything. In my last two relapses I didnt eat anything at all and my family did not take my mental health as seriously. This time I did eat just ate less. My parents were more open and supportive this time because I was more open with them.  I went to my therapist yesterday who advised I go to my PD and get a depression evaluation, who advised I go to a psychiatric clinic and get examined by them. While there a woman was having a nasty outburst and the RN we were talking to told me that my issue wasnt as bad as them by a long shot but that I clearly could use some medical assistance.  They put me as an outpatient. I went home ate 2 pizza slices and 3 cucumber slices with some green tea/honey blend. Ate an orange and drank some chamomile tea then went to bed.  Today was somewhat better. I ate a fourth of breakfast, ate spoonfuls of leftover ground beef with zucchini. Had V8 fruit drink with it. A few hours later I ate 1 serving of cambles chunk old fashioned soup. Stomach cramped a bit with that meal but I managed. Ate an orange some time later and managed to go to my part time job. On my way there I bought ginger ale, some fruit blend juice, and a 6pc chicken nuggets from Walmart(mcdonalds inside my Walmart). Ate it at work surprisingly. Thought it would boost me but I still felt I was lacking. Felt tired and kinda void while at work. When I came home I ate a small serving of what my mom made (some chicken, macaroni, and some greens and spices with my ginger ale I didnt finish at work).  **The dark thought**  While eating I dinner I had to stop cause a thought shot through my head like a sniper bullet. This ugly reoccurring thought of ""You are gonna have to eat every day for the rest of your life. So you will feel like this every day.""  The thought makes me feel sick but then it tends to subside and hunger takes over. Its making me feel uneasy, almost like I cant do this.

I’ve called a doctor and they said if i don’t experience any other symptoms (vomiting, extreme headaches, dizziness, etc.) i should be fine and it could have just been a ligament popping. I’m also seeing my therapist and a doctor in-person tomorrow morning which will hopefully relieve most of my  .  Despite knowing that, if something was really really wrong, i would have most likely seen symptoms by now, my   won’t let me fall asleep easily since this incident. I’ve been on the phone most nights while i fall asleep with my friend which helps, and i try to do some light meditation when i’m really freaking out, but i’m still really scared.

I take medication for it but i haven’t been on it for a while (i just always forget to refill it.) i’d like to get back on it but i’m nervous if i possibly am having brain issues it would make it worse.

Ive always had difficulty getting words out, like a stammer. It has its ups and downs, but ultimately I can never say things how I want to, or when I want to. When I speak its a constant battle of ""when will I freeze"", or often Ill try speak and no words will come out. The only way I can speak is if I act uninterested and fairly monotonous, and even then its a struggle. If I try tell a joke my delivery becomes informative and serious.  The worst is when Im in a group and were joking (or even one on one joking) and I want to say something to add to conversation, but I physically cant.

TL;DR: If my female boss of 6 months doesn’t say hello, goodbye, or assign me new work for the day, my entire self worth plummets. Imposter syndrome through the roof.   If we don’t have any basic interactions that day, I will be completely defeated and paranoid by the end of the day.   Conversely, if we have a number of great interactions, I will feel elated and a very strong sense of belonging.   I look up to her. I’m friendly with her. She’s a really cool person in my eyes.

The entire year was great for a long ass time... until something happened. Basically there were these group of kids at school, real fucking assholes that wont leave people alone. I decided to stand up for my friend which was being bothered by these assholes but i guess this is where it begun.. i got in a fight with one of the guys and well i got beat up. Not thag badly tho but i realised that some stupid ass kids were recording everything. It didnt even take an hour and my entire class kneq about it. I couldnt even go anywhere without people looking at me. It was also around that time i got super self consious and always thought people were whispering my name as i walk pass them and sometimes i still do. One time these kids ganged up on me and threatened to break my arm and stuff with lots of other kids watching from the back. I managed to escape though. But fast forward later on it all passed. They started the leave me the fuck alone buuuut it really had a huge effect. People getting mad at me really really makes me anxious. Like usaully i let the teachers scream their lungs out at me but now i get fucking terrified.. i get lots of homework and i forget to do some a lot of times and i always get scared thinking how the teachers will react. Because sometimes i did not do my homework and well... i got pretty much so anxious i had to ask the teacher to go to the bathroom and i went and pretty much cried like a fucking baby. Yes and im a guy.. pathetic isnt it? Oh and it got even worse. My grades arent going so well so my parents contacted someome at school to help me with these stuff. So once in class they said over the intercom i had to go to some place. I was terrified because i thought i was in some trouble, even though i didnt even do anything. It was nothing bad, just the person my parents contacted to help me with my grades.

I generally dislike being in public while doing literally anything, like performing a task. I straight panic because everyone constantly has their own better way of doing things and always feel the need to share or critique what I’m doing.   Just now I got home from work and my routine is usually to take my puppy for a walk when the weather permits. He’s only 9 months old so we’re still working on a lot of things. This has been a major   trigger for me since we’ve gotten him - I have no issues training in the house but when we get in public I’m terrified of people watching me constantly fail because he’s still a work in progress.   He was having an awful walk today - not listening to me, pulling, sniffing EVERYTHING and taking forever, eating sticks. I decided to cut it short and was heading back home when a couple was across the street walking slightly behind us in the same direction with three dogs. Naturally my puppy started going ballistic and stopping and turning to look at them every two seconds. I would normally turn and walk the other way but I was pretty close to my house and I honestly didn’t want the walk to be any longer than it needed to be by walking the other direction. So I stopped entirely and waited for them to get ahead of us enough that we could walk behind. Three separate times they felt it was necessary to turn around, glare at me and repeat ‘I don’t know why she needs to just stand there and stop. Why would she do that.’  I realize other people wouldn’t think literally anything of this but I was mortified that they had something negative to say and I was so angry. I immediately texted my bf about how embarrassed I was and his response was ‘who cares’.  Which  is a typical response any time I try to share my feelings with him.

1782,p14gu3,1.0,Trying to cope with the fact that I may not be neurotypical..,"TL;DR at bottom I (16F) have been dealing with very severe  -induced panic attacks for the past 4 years, on top of a general feeling that something is wrong, always. I guess until recently no one really took me seriously when I said I thought I might have a mental problem, probably because of my age, the stigma around it, the fact that I mostly had them at home when no one was there... even my therapist (who I had to ask my dad to take me to) was very averse to even calling them panic attacks until last month. Recently Ive been getting worse both mentally and in my ability to control myself- Ive had a few very severe ones at school, and have been trying to injure myself when in such a state.  I had to go to the hospital due to feinting spells stemming off of heart issues coming from my  , and currently also have a breathing problem from the same reason. The real kicker for me was when the school counselor randomly sent my parents an email that essentially said that I am disruptive and have a serious problem, and that he has never seen a student that acts like this in his entire career. I know there is truth to my disruptiveness, im not trying to argue that, but now all of a sudden my friends and family are acting like im going crazy/ suddenly have a huge mental problem, and my therapist is suggesting i go to a psychiatrist on top of her, aka that I need medication. Im honestly really scared at the prospect of being branded mentally ill! Its not even that I personally have anything against it, but seeing peoples behavior towards me change as they realise i wasnt joking is really messing with my head! I feel like suddenly im subhuman in a way- some people coddle me, some treat me like Im crazy. I guess what Im asking for is- is there anyone here whose been through a similar situation? How did you deal with it? How do you deal with... actually knowing there is something wrong with your cognitive functions..? TL;DR everyone in my life is suddenly aware of my mental problems and treating me different as a result, and im having a hard time coping..",1553634473,1553634475,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b5vb3i/trying_to_cope_with_the_fact_that_i_may_not_be/,False,False,0.0

1785,TheAmazingPikachu,1.0,My teacher said I was socially intimidating (not to my face). What does this mean?,"Ive been informed by another student that one of my teachers (who I interact with a fair amount) went to the school nurse in a bit of a state, and told her that Im socially intimidating. This is not the first time this teacher has went to the school nurse upset, and I can only assume its my fault (as I have been brought up both times Im aware its happened). I dont have a bad relationship with this teacher - I actually thought we were on pretty good terms. Both of us have   and theyve come out to me about a lot of bad things from her past, which I found really surprising they were willing to tell a student about. Right down to details about their divorce and who got the furniture.   Since I was told about this Ive been fretting about what they meant by socially intimidating. The student didnt tell me any more.   I dont think theres anything wrong with my interaction skills, and I definitely havent noticed anything in particular being off about the way weve spoken recently. Theyve been quite horrible about a drama performance, but Ive kept the swearing to until theyre out the room. Even then, though, the student said it was about a week ago, and there wasnt a massive problem then.   Can anyone offer any input? Im honestly quite hurt about it. Once that teacher had an   attack and from what I heard I induced it, or at least didnt help, and I still dont know how. I only learned about it a few months later because the person who witnessed it didnt want to upset me and have me worrying about it.   I would ask the school nurse myself, as I feel she would tell me because it involves me. Were on good terms, and often bitch to each other about people and whatever dramas going on at the moment (even when she probably shouldnt). Problem is, Im terrified of going to speak to her so it barely ever happens.   So, tl;dr, does anyone know what that means? I cant think of anything glaringly obvious and I hate to think Im making them uncomfortable just by being around them.

Four weeks in Dublin, living with a host family, working at a university, meeting new people, seeing the ""world"", etc. But here is the thing:  I am SO afraid about all of that  Now you maybe think ""Hey thats pretty normal. Different country, different work setting. After some time this will go away""  Probably not.  I cant even do the stuff that they want me to do here in Germany.  Talking to people on the phone? - I would rather send 30 E-Mails, go there personally or eat a glass bottle  Talking to people? - Not without that weird chest pain that I always get when I talk to someone and the desire to run away as fast as possible so i dont embarrass myself  Going out with (new) friends? - Friends? Never heard of them.  Talking with host family? - I cant even talk to my family. For me it also seems like I am intruding in their daily lifes. Also those god awful awkward pauses that make me evaluate my life choices to pack my shit and never return.  Working with customers/ colleagues? - Not without the 20 - 30 Minute bathroom break where I cry because I would rather die then go out there  And the worst thing that could possibly happen is that I disappoint my parents. That they give me this look. This ""Where did we go wrong"" look. This ""Your brothers would have never done this"" look. I cant stand it. It makes me physically sick and I start to question myself if this is really worth it. I wish I could just be someone else but unfortunately im still me.  I tried to talk to them but they wont listen. I cant sleep at night. I know need to take medicine so I can get at least 3 hours of sleep but they still wont listen.

1790,KarlTravnicek,1.0,Sexual anxiety,"Im not a native speaker so I hope you forgive my subpar english. My story goes like this: I am a 29 year old virgin. I had a handful of opportunities of having sex for the first time throughout my live, but nothing ever happened because I panicked or I pushed people away. Two years ago I met a nice colleague who was in a distant relationship at the time. I became friends with her and I was able to enjoy my time. Dancing, talking and some playful flirting, without the fear of something ever happening. Sometimes I got sad thinking about the possibility of her moving to her boyfriend, but most of the time I was able to enjoy the moment. But than it happened. She became single and her playful flirting started to get serious. I had no idea how to react to that. At first I thought I should ask her out on a date, but I knew she just wanted to have some fun and I started to panic because I was scared I couldnt get an erection when it gets serious. (Already happened twice) Than she started talking about some other guy and I got crazy jealous. Like most guys I really wanted to lose my virginity, but my   was always stronger. First I tried to push her away, than I told her about my virginity. She started to get really excited, because she always wanted to deflower a guy. (Its on her list apparently) at first that made me happy but not for long. I got scared again once I realized Im horrible at flirting when there is a chance of getting  laid. I told her that we should stay friends, but I couldnt hide the fact that something was wrong. Now Im scared she doesnt want anything to do with me again. Im also scared of people in my workplace starting to talk. Im scared of losing my job, because Im not able to calm down. My heart is pounding like crazy every time I wake up. I cry every time I think about all the fun we had. I googled the number of suicides in my hometown, wondering if people would think Im weird if I killed myself. (In retrospect, thats kinda funny) fuuuuuuuk I dont know. I took a vacation so I can find a therapist, but I accidentally told my boss I had psychological problems and by the look of her I knew she doesnt want anything to do with it. Fuck it.

Why can’t I stop feeling like this?,"I left a horrendous working environment 6 months ago where my boss was a complete narcissist and totally paranoid that I had some sort of power over everyone else. I didn’t. He didn’t realise they all thought he was a complete and utter joke. He proved this to us in a daily basis, but he blamed me verbally most of the time. He still has no idea the rumours were circulated by his current staff!  It was only a short term position but I ended up leaving about a month early. I was so physical and mentally strained from the experience that it was a huge relief to just leave.  But over the past 6 months some of my former colleagues have come to me telling me some things my former boss has said, and continues to say about me.  I know I shouldn’t care because I’ve washed my hands of it all but it really hurts. The mere mention of his name just gets me so angry now and upset now.   I’ve spent days recently where I’ve had to try so hard not to cry for seemingly no reason at all. I have a tight feeling in my chest all the time and it’s as if one half of my brain is just imprinted with memories of my old work.   It’s as if every time I seemingly start to feel better about it, he rears his ugly head again and an obsession consumes.  I’m leaving town in a couple of months so I hope the distance will help. But the thought of him bad mouthing me to my friends and people that know and respect me is really making me anxious. I feel like he’s won a victory over me - but there’s no victory to win. I left. I had no intention of going back. I don’t want to go back. But I feel like I am stuck in a fog.  I’d be grateful if anyone has any ideas to help.

So last January,I finally started college.I was so excited to finally start this new chapter of my life and have the true college experience (making friends,going places,creating memories,etc.).I was so full of hope and was truly looking forward to this new experience.But things havent exactly gone as I hoped it would and it seems that since starting school,my social   has actually gotten worse.I so far have made zero friends.I have talked to people in class occasionally,but it never goes beyond the classroom.I even tried joining my schools anime club two semesters ago,but didnt go to any of the meetings after the first one because I felt to out of place and awkward.And then there are activities that happen at my dorm building,but the thought of going to one of them alone terrifies me,so Im usually in my room.  And on top of my non existent social life,my classes are starting to make me anxious.I failed two classes last semester,which really messed up my gpa.I told myself that I would do much better this semester,but now I dont think I can do it and its only the first week of the semester.Looking at the syllabuses for my classes,I honestly dont think Im smart or talented enough to pass these courses.Im planning on transferring since Ive decided to change my career path,but I still want to do decent in this last semester and pass at least with a 70 or higher in my classes,but now Im not sure if I can achieve that.  And on top of all of that,this transferring situation is also stressing me out.Im scared Im not going to get accepted into the school I applied for and if that happens,I really dont know what Ill do.   Im sorry for my rambling,but I dont usually let out my feelings,not even in written form,so Im kinda struggling to lay my thoughts out in a coherent manner.Im just really discouraged right now and afraid for my future,both socially and academically.I feel so isolated from everyone and like my situation isnt ever going to improve.I want to get help for my  ,but Im too afraid to even go to the school counselor.

1802,writer02135,1.0,I was nice to a crying stranger and then she wanted my contact info because I'm too nice,"TLDR: my   is better since I started Zoloft years ago, but Im in a bit of a tense   spiral after I tried to comfort a stranger and ended up having her friend me on Facebook. Im having trouble relaxing about this because I know its nothing BIG but I also dont want to be friends with her for real?? But am I also making some judgment about her? You know how it is.     So during my 30-minute lunch break I was killing time before my food would be ready for pickup, and I passed a young woman (my age, early-20s) who was crying on a phone in a food court, huddled by a doorway. I thought to myself, well, if I was crying that much, I would want someone to check on me. And if she needs HELP help (medical, crisis, etc.) its better to have asked. So, I walked up and asked her if she was okay, accompanied by apologies in case she didnt want me to talk with her. She hung up and started talking to me. She had been having some sort of   attack and was trying to roll a joint to calm herself down, but someone passing by had given her a judgmental look (she told me later she had yelled at them). Feeling her on the   front, I empathized with her and we chatted until she had stopped crying. I offered to block the wind from the door opening so she could roll it--again, seemed nice to do, and not a big deal for me to offer.  Anyway, she asks if we could go outside the building so she can smoke, and Im like, well, Im on lunch break and I want to make sure shes alright before I head off, so I follow and awkwardly chat. (I say awkwardly but it probably went okay.) We talk and she tells me about some stuff shes dealing with (sobriety, parent stuff, work stuff,  ), some of which I have no experience with but I want to be supportive and Anyway, she says shes going to meet one of her friends. Then she asks, hey, could I have your number? Not in any weird way, but I recognize that I had been really nice and supportive of her. ""Or Facebook or Snapchat or whatever.""

And on the other hand maybe we would but it seems like a lot/overwhelming. So Im spinning out worst case scenarios and unable to chill out and let it go.     Do I accept her request?

If anything is wrong with their body, they calmly wait for their doctors appointment without wondering if something is seriously wrong. If they feel nauseous, they comfortably shove a finger down their throat and puke before going off to work like nothing happened. They travel to different countries and dont worry about being too far from home, friends, or family in the case of an emergency. They take comfort in living their lives, not denying themselves the life they want to live for fear of disappointment. There are people out there like this and I cant believe it.

1818,chris8816,1.0,"How I was able to control my anxiety, once and for all","I just wanted to share my story in case it is helpful to anyone. I recognize that everyone is different and what worked for me may not work for others.   I have struggled with severe   for about 10 years, starting shortly after I graduated college and began my first job. I have always been a Type A person who is also an over thinker and a chronic worrier. My panic attacks first started on a congested highway in Dallas at rush hour. Out of the blue, my heart started racing and beating like it was going to come out of my chest. I felt like I was choking. My hands and lips were tingly, and I started to get tunnel vision. I was certain I was dying. I swerved into the breakdown lane and went as fast as possible to the nearest exit and pulled off the highway to catch my breath. Over the next several years, my   became almost instantly triggered by highways, so much so that I stopped driving. I later moved to NYC, and when the panic attacks started on the train, I avoided those situations as well. I avoided crowds. I avoided airplanes. When they started to happen during work meetings and presentations, I tried to avoid those. My world was becoming smaller and smaller everyday. Textbook agoraphobia.  I am sure this story sounds all too familiar for many of you, and I am sorry for what all of you have had to go through. Over the years I tried so many different things to fix my   and panic disorder. I read books and listened to tapes on mediation, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. I changed my diet. I exercised. I cut out caffeine. I took probiotics religiously because I read an article on the brain-gut connection. I had blood tests and EKGs done. I spoke with trusted people about it. I prayed. My   still persisted throughout all of this. Despite my efforts, I refused to go to the doctor about it and discuss my full history with   and my need for help. Not sure if it was because of pride or not, but I refused to see a doctor because I knew theyd just medicate me. About 9 months ago I started getting really bad daily palpitations and had to wear a heart monitor for a couple weeks. I was having premature ventricular contractions, about 1% of my beats. Throughout the day, that is a lot. All of my heart tests looked good otherwise and they just assumed it was stress/ . That was my breaking point. Years of unresolved stress and   had materialized in the form of recurring daily heart palpitations that lasted for a couple months.  I finally agreed to ask about getting medicine for help. I was diagnosed with generalized   disorder and put on Zoloft, working my way up to 100mg. The side effects for me were minimal (just lasting longer in bed which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you ask).  After being on the medicine for about 7 months, I have noticed my baseline for dealing with stressful situations has gone up. The palpitations have stopped. I am able to tolerate things so much better now. I am driving on highways again. My son is being treated for cancer, and its helping me deal through that. When I feel those occasional tinges of   coming on, I can use CBT techniques or pray to reassure myself and disarm the situation, but the medicine is definitely helping as well. My panic attacks have gone from several times a week to practically non existent. I also think it has helped me to believe that   is no longer a part of my life.  I just wanted to encourage anyone who is afraid to talk to their doctor about their  . Despite my best efforts to fix it on my own, I believe I truly had a chemical inbalance that was out of my control and that couldnt be resolved with natural techniques.   does not have to run our lives, and I just wanted to encourage you guys to keep up the fight against it.

1832,PragmaRose,1.0,18F overprotective parent is hurting my chances of bettering my anxiety,"Long post, sorry.  BACKGROUND:   •  and depression I have   that effects my daily life massively. I knew I wasn’t normal, depression grew from there on. Until recently, my father always told me I was overreacting, “everyone has  ” and that it will go away as I grow older. My   attacks (feeling sick to my stomach, shaking, IBS, gagging and occasional vomiting) caused me to be yelled at tremendously by my father. Telling me to knock it off and stop playing around. (As if anyone ever would want to live like this) This in turn made my attacks and depression more severe.   Luckily.. my mom finally believed me after I outright refused to go to my graduation ceremony and have stayed home since graduating. Around the end of 2018, for the first time in my life I got help from a doctor. I’m on   meds now. Light and generic.  •What kind of father I have  We get along 75% of the time. But the 25% we don’t is rough. He’s stubborn. Hard to confront. Never physically abusive. Verbally mean.. when I try to confront about how it hurts being called a bitch by my own father, someone I look up to for praise, I’m told I’m being a literal snowflake and sensitive. At some degree I believe that I’m just really sensitive. But at the same time I know the majority of fathers hasn’t called their daughter a bitch whenever there’s a disagreement. Fathers are supposed to raise us up not down right?  When I go into hard times where my self hatred is at its peek. I tell myself that I’m a bitch profusely. Worthless. Weak. Useless. A waste of space. I write unhealthy rants to myself about how much of a bitch I am. I’m not logical when I’m upset. I can’t tell my father how much the name calling actually affects me, in fear he’ll refuse or fail to change.   After becoming an outcast and having 0 irl friends, I turned to gaming. It led me to having really great friendships and memories I’ll cherish for a while.    WHAT HAPPENED:   This shit storm all started with me wanting to go to the store for an energy drink. Due to my   meds I get drowsy and this certain day I needed to work on something. It was already 10 am and I had a hard time getting out of bed, the drowsiness (plus lack of motivation) gets in the way.   I asked my father if he could get me an energy drink at the nearby store. I forgot the reason but he didn’t want to. So I asked if I could just walk there and buy it myself with my own money. I mentioned how this can be good for my   to go by myself. Since I’ve never went anywhere by myself and hardly bought my own stuff by myself. Said no, it’s dangerous. I got a little irritated. Mentioned how I’m almost 19 and can’t even go somewhere by myself. Asked what age until I’m allowed to ever walk to the store by myself. (That’s HALF A BLOCK AWAY) He jokingly said never. After that he tried to compromise saying he would walk me there and wait outside the store. Took the offer despite still feeling really dependent.  Later that day, I was trying to finish a project and wanted to pull an all nighter if I couldn’t finish it because it had to be done by the next day. It’s a painting for my aunt’s loss of her brother.   My father tells me I need to wrap it up and that I’m not pulling an all nighter. I get visibly sad but don’t say anything. I started feeling helpless, like I had no control over my actions despite feeling I should at this age.   Of course he sensed this. Mocked me saying “oh no she’s mad at me” When in reality, I was just depressed about how I have no say in my life. I did not correct him, as it would have led to an argument and I was craving endless sleep at this point. He went on. Asking if I knew how much stress I cause him. Mentioning he currently has heart pains due to me appearing to be mad at him. Saying he would have been hospitalized from all the stress of him being home while I walk to the store alone (Again.. HALF A BLOCK AWAY) Mentions how he walked me to get an energy drink. Saying more things, I don’t remember exactly, that he did for me to hang over my head. I remained quiet to not stir anything up. It felt like he was trying to bait me to say something so it would get more heated the whole time..   Let me be clear that I live in a safe neighborhood with no news of kidnapping or murder since I’ve lived here from 10 years old. Elementary kids walk home alone or in pairs throughout our neighborhood. I’m not even allowed to go to the neighborhood park by myself, which is directly next to the elementary school and filled with other kids.   THE ISSUE:  I’ve realized that he’s a major helicopter parent and I need help. It’s damaging my hopes of conquering   and being independent. I don’t know how I can get him to see that his overprotective parenting skills are not helping me get ready for the real world or anything for that matter.   Confronting him with anything usually ends with him getting explosive and me crying my eyes out feeling hopeless along with nothing changing.   I’ve never had a job due to  . No driver license due to  . No irl friends due to  . Lost online friendships because my dad would question me too much about them until I got too stressed to handle it. Not going to college. Nothing really going for me.   And the kicker, I’m too afraid to make an independent move even with my father disagreeing because I feel sick and scared when I know he’s upset with me. And I tried not to let what he said get to me, but he’s had bad chest pains before due to us fighting. I almost feel I have to stay home forever so I’m not the reason he dies or for hospital bills.     Tldr: Helicopter dad is too over protective and is ruining my chances of getting my   more bearable.

I’ve noticed this myself, but also my friends have told me this many times. I’m currently a little over halfway through my 2nd semester of college, and I have started to feel extremely anxious this last week or two. Since the beginning of college (including moving away from home), my emotions have definitely been acting up more than ever before, but just recently I have a constant overwhelming feeling hanging over me, with a sense of dread. I’ve been reaching out to my closer friends and my boyfriend this last week about it, and most of them seem to think it’s because I am really struggling with school this semester, which has never happened before. I was at the top of my class in high school, and suddenly I’ll be struggling to keep a 3.0 for this semester, which is very unlike me usually. I know that this probably has to do with the way I’m feeling, but whenever I get extremely anxious and upset, I’m never thinking about school. It just happens. I think I’m still just angry and upset that I am having to live this way suddenly and that all of this is happening at once, but I just really don’t know what to do about this all happening. I feel miserable and like there is no way out. I made an appointment for next week with a counselor/therapist at my college through the free psychological services provided, but I have already talked to so many people close to me about this that I don’t know how that will help in any way. Any advice on why or how this slump is happening and what to do about it would be greatly appreciated.",1553616954,1553616955,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b5ro85/first_time_dealing_with_moderate_anxiety/,False,False,0.0
1836,Delphicdragon,1.0,"The ""crazy bitch box"" concept","I have a co-worker who knows exactly how to spike my   and those of others in the office.  This is the person who CCs your boss if theres a typo in a \*draft\* document you create (complete with screenshots and red circles), who reports you to the boss if youre 5 minutes late to do a task for her or dont do it fast enough, and who will get in your face and yell at you if you DARE question her.  All in all, a peach to work with. My boss is aware of these issues but he gets the same treatment from her, and at this point has all her daily e-mails (30+) re-routed to spam.   She was in a mood this morning and we had to interact. Cue a 45 minute yelling fit because I dared ask her a scheduling question and because of her 45 minute rant, everything was late, which led to more yelling.  Normally, this gets me very anxious as yelling is a big trigger for me. My   is deeply rooted in my penchant for perfectionism and wanting validation from others. So, I would normally be a mess after this interaction.    But, last week, my therapist introduced me to what she called the ""crazy bitch box"" theory.  When my coworker starts ranting/yelling, I simply imagine placing her in a soundproof box and shutting the door.  This soundproof box is the ""crazy bitch box"" and she stays there. She can rant all she wants while she is in the box, and the box contains her so what she says/does cant hurt me.  My having that visualization, my   about interacting with her is minimized.  85% of what she says gets her placed in the ""crazy bitch box"" and Im so much calmer because somehow with her in the box, I feel safer.  Plus, the idea of someone stuck in a tiny Plexiglas box makes me giggle.   Hoping this concept might help someone here.

During this time I stop playing video games, missed school, missed work, and just had so many ugly horrible thoughts. Lots of pacing around my home, heart rate spikes, and just overall irritability.   I went to my therapist, PD, and a psychiatric center yesterday. All with my parents. It was a long day and  I only ate a fourth of my breakfast, one banana for lunch and two slices of pizza along with 3 cucumbers for dinner. 1 orange, 1 nature valley peanut butter wheat biscut, and chamomile tea as an evening snack  I actually started feeling better last evening. Not 100 percent but a lot better.  Today however I woke up with huge BM urges and a mild appetite. Woke up feeling good until the thoughts came back and I started to feel ill again. I ate like a 4th of my breakfast and 2 daily vitamins. I dont feel hungry but I do feel weak-ish when I do things. I dont feel heart racing or massive  , im tight rope walking between feeling better and feeling horrible.  **So again, what can I eat in the mornings for this stuff?

Fortunately, I have a clean record and an extensive (voluntary) history of volunteer work with churches, nonprofits, animal shelters, and food banks.  That combined with other background info has spared me.  It wont go on my record, but the fact that I let that happen is haunting me more and more every day.     My fiance had been traveling a lot for work around that time, so I had started drinking even more to cope with the loneliness and   resulting from being alone.  I ran out of alcohol much, much earlier than planned one night, I put my dog in the car with me because he loves car rides, and off we went.  We made it to the store fine.  I got what I needed and turned around to go home.  On the way back, someone cut the driver in front of me off, the first fella slammed on the brakes to not run through a yellow light, the guy he cut off did too, and I had been looking down to get something that fell out of my pocket.  I had slowed down enough to not hurt anyone.  In fact, it was the smallest of bump-ups.  No dents in either car.  Hardly scratches.  About 90% of the impact area isnt even able to be seen unless the cars are wet.  But thats not the point...     I cant believe I did that.  And I had cut myself in the store parking lot before attempting to return home.  After I rear-ended the folks in front of me, I used my car keys to cut more.  It was gruesome.  I wouldve been taken to jail, but I was put into a psych ward for about a month.  I found out from my fiance, who has stuck by me and saw this as a much-needed opportunity for me to learn and grow, that my dog was taken to the local pound until he could return home and pick him up the next day.  I feel incredibly guilty that that is what makes me feel the worst, but I think its just my logic...  I know that no one was hurt, but there was still an effect that was worse than minor scratches and court fees.  My dog was horrified.  I cannot believe I put him through that, especially when I had taken him so that he could enjoy the warmer weather and sticking his head out of the window.     Ive had my first court date, and because I was taken immediately to the hospital instead of the PD, only a blood test results will be received by the police to confirm my BAC.  It was high...  The nurses told me while I was in the hospital.  It was a 0.21.  I will only have to pay fees and for the paint for the car I hit, but getting off so easily is making me suffer more mentally, I think.  It will probably be better for me in the long term since Ive sorted through things myself in a way that wouldnt have been possible if the scenario was even a bit different, but for right now, its terrible.  I started having panic attacks after they finally subsided, and back in February, work put me on a medical leave of absence so that I could relax and get more therapy time.  But having so much free time has been messing with my mind...  And I love, Love, LOVE my job, so Ive been missing it terribly.  Ive been picking up old hobbies like painting, drawing, and reading, but what I really want is to get back into the swing of things as they were.  I want to improve myself from the experience and move forward.     Im sure most of you have not been in this situation, but I felt that you could understand the feelings of   that Ive got to cope with right now.  Hopefully if anyone of you are close to making the same mistake that I made you will see a bit of the light and prevent that from happening.  I couldve killed someone.

1875,Colacolaman,1.0,My story,"I’d like to tell my story, it’s not the most interesting but I feel writing this may help. I’m an incoherent writer so reading this may be a task in itself.   has been a burden of mine for 9 months. I go through spells of being mentally great and mentally poor. I’m a 25 year old male with many friends and one I would call my best friend. Also, I love going to the gym as my mental health vastly improves when I’m exercising.   Alcohol was something I enjoyed from ages 16-23 but when the hangovers got too bad I decided to attempt to stop. I’ve never been an alcoholic, more of just a student who drinks frequently and to excess (probably technically an alcoholic).  My issue originally started when I stopped drinking as much. This led to less social occasions as the majority of my friends at the time would drink Friday and Saturday night 12+ pints. I’m from Scotland and the social events here are essentially just drinking lots. Less social occasions led to less interactions with humans and more staring at a wall in the dark, which led to my spiral. I eventually caved and started drinking again, socially I should add, but this led to painful and lonely hangovers. I started to experience something I had never experienced before;  .  A decided to not drink which led to increased loneliness. However, every cloud has a silver lining. This led to further time in the gym. Making progress aesthetically and strength wise. I was happy with my gym life but it didn’t fill the gap of my decreased social life. I I decided to give alcohol another chance. Which in turn meant less time in the gym as I physically wasn’t fit enough to get out of bed; not doing what I love.  This was my darkest time; 5 months ago when I decided to get help. I went to the doctors with a severe bout of depression and 3 panic attacks in as many days. I currently take Sertraline everyday to combat the depression and  . I should add I haven’t been depressed in around 7/8 weeks.   I meet up with my best friend once a week just to chill out, watch tv, usual stuff. We also meet up another day maybe for the gym or food. We talk about everything, as best friends do. He knows all about my   and is very supportive. Him and I were big drinkers through 16-23, would drink with each other all the time. He still loves his drink and that’s completely fine with me but it means I lose him that 1 day a week where he goes out and does things without me. This type of thing would never have bothered me but since my   started I feel slightly paranoid at the same time.   Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I start speaking to a girl. (I’m not an introvert by any means. I love talking to people. I work in an office of hundreds and if any of them have guessed I suffer from   I’ll be surprised as I feel I mask it). She’s great; funny, intelligent, successful, loves the gym, beautiful, not really a drinker and she asked for my number! I’m thinking jackpot.. However, we only talk intermittently due to her being so busy. She values her gym time and friends which is why she resonates with me so much, she’s me as a female. But.. whenever she doesn’t text me back my   comes on so hard because I feel I’m letting her down in some regard. I feel I’m letting her slip away, disappointing her.   So that’s my story up until today. Thanks for reading.",1553594027,1553594028,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b5nqyf/my_story/,False,False,0.0
1876,pKievit,1.0,LOVE,"I think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing.  To love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated.  One would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive.  In reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it.   In the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love.  Love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of “being in love,” this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love.  Many of us do not know what love is… little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or “being in love,” as sex,  as enmeshment or even as codependency… but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love.  Then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically… the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is.  Love is like a multifaceted diamond. As a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent,  reliable… it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable… it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better.  This is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced.   For too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant… and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security… when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused.  In this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved… as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could… on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love… we didnt know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it… if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them.  For many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us… being truthful was not as important as being safe. Being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse.  In our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love… our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. So we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry.  As children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. These influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though “being in love” is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth.  Little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime…  For many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how… a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain.  One of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response… however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored… this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs.  That is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities.   As if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. Typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. Why? Our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain… we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. Therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. Why? Because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty…. All of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger.  What our subconscious associates with safety is certainty… so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front… all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe… we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. Usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. These people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were… attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies.  One of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong… youve never experienced love or given love…. Youve only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or “being in love,” none of which on its own is true love.  To fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. The challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. Unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories… so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. Here is an example from my own life:  As a young adult, I knew I hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. This I knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. It wasnt until my 40s that I realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. As a baby, I didnt like porridge, so like most babies I spat it out… this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out… when I learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that I would hurry up and swallow so I could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. Sad story… but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge… this is my earliest memory of subjugation… the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do… subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. It also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. It also contributed to enmeshment where I quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as I was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. Here is another example from my childhood:  I cant remember why, but I remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6… I was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed… as most 6 year olds would do I cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing… as an adult looking back I think this made my mum feel bad… she didnt like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much… another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that I will get punished for feeling sorry for myself… in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and I should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate.  For me personally, this has been my experience… my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self… this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency… all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and  .  It is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good… and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good.  So how the hell do we undo this?  Not easily and not quickly… it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments.  To undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. As a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum… but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse… our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response.  Now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. In order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. For me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected… this pain I was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. Knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, I meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie… its not and never was a true representation of love… I meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents… then I let myself get angry… at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods… I got angry at the injustice of life itself… I started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off… I listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as Leo Morachioli “Killing in the Name of” and “Give it Away” and “Sabotage.” In all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean… they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it.  Of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs… the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be… but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from.  From that point on, you can start fresh… you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. You can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you… because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world wont care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say.  You simply cannot love others if you dont love yourself. If you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem,  what possible love do you have left to give away to others? On a basic level you dont even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone… so you cant show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself… this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. Only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others… you cannot do this from a place of emptiness.  Even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need… however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got.",1553593944,1553593945,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b5nqm3/love/,False,False,0.0

Ive been a manager, Ive been a waitress, etc. Right now I work at a bakery as counter help. Ive only been there 2 months or so. Working hard has always been something I take pride in but I cant do this anymore. When I first started I had an awesome schedule of 30-35 hours a week, sometimes even getting out at 2pm! Now after 2 people quitting at the same time. I am now the only counter help person and I work 45 or so hours, and shifts that are 8-5:30 (close) sometimes 9-5:30 (close) and I do that without getting a day off for 6 or 7 days. I used to be able to handle that workload no problem but now I fear I cant anymore and I cant handle work like I used to. Im only 24! I feel like Im 80 though. I suffer from back pain and can barely move after work. I am in so much pain it brings tears to my eyes and no one takes me seriously my whole life due to my age. I have had so many bad things happen this month that I used to use work to get my mind off things and now its one of the problems. I had a full blown   attack at work two days ago and humiliated myself. I couldnt keep it together. I wanted to go home so bad, Im still so ashamed. My coworkers barely know me, theres only one girl I really like and I still have my guard up. My   is spiking right now just thinking about having to go in for the 6th 8-cl shift in a row. I have the next two days off and my best friend is coming down to see me and normally I would be so happy but I just want a break from everyone and the world for one day. Im so depressed right now and I cant believe its over a fucking bakery job. I have to do the same schedule next week  Im so tired mentally and physically and the pain is unreal.

I’m a 21 year old dude and never has a sexual encounter I’ve had been the result of me being interested in a woman, talking to her of my own volition and making it happen. I just always sit back and wait for whoever wants me to take me. I feel like I’ve given up all agency in my sexual life.  Today I went on a tinder date; I’m pretty sure I could have made a move: we were sitting by the water, late at night with nobody around and she was casually touching me a lot, but I got paralyzed. There were multiple opportunities, but instead of even deciding to leave (I was kinda far from home) I did nothing. I didn’t make a move and I didn’t leave, I just sat there with this girl who’s only visiting town for a few days, and I ended up getting home at 145 AM after she finally decided she needed to go back to her hotel.  I’m so angry at myself. I freeze up and can never go after what I want and I feel completely impotent. My friends don’t seem to understand how serious I feel this is, just telling me to go after a girl next time as if I don’t tell myself that every single time.  Maybe at the end of the day it’s true, but it’s not that simple. I have no idea how to navigate the execution and it honestly terrifies me, not only putting myself up for rejection like that but also the hooking up itself. I’ve actually never had sex: every time I’ve gotten the opportunity I’ve been impotent in the literal sense. So not only do I not go after what I want, but experience thus far has shown that even if I did, it wouldn’t matter.   I feel so hopeless in this realm.

Now, just my first job is challenging enough, but Ive been their 3 years now, I love my coworkers, and its actually helped me confront/handle some of my   triggers. But since hours are low, I only work about 2-3 days a week, with shifts rarely going over 5 hours, so its an easy job.   But this new job will be a shock to my system. A) Ive never worked two jobs at once before, never thought I even would be able to because of how crippling my symptoms can get. B) Im now going to be working nearly every day, which means little rest for the first few months, and Im so scared that Im going to end up fucking failing at yet another job (the three years at the theater is the first job Ive lasted more than a year), or get overwhelmed, or that the coworkers may not like me. I hope they arent ass holes and are understanding of my mental illness, not that Im going to parade it around and tell everyone that, but there could be times I may have a panic attack, which I dread the thought of, and then get accused of incompetence or get fired.      Im basically just venting this out. Any tips on job interviews? Beyond the dress nice and talk clearly part, Im just praying I dont shell up and become a stuttering mess. Its so hard to stay confident for longer than 5 minutes. Every time I think I will thrive at this job, I suddenly get a wave of terror. But I HAVE to make this work, and if nearly every one else can do it, so can I, right?  Plus its a record/bluray/music/books/video game, etc. store. Im a huge junkie of all those things, especially films, music, and books. So Ill at least know what Im talking about from the start.  One of my favorite shops in town actually, I love the environment, and Ill be able to dye my hair again. Just please God let me get this job and be a good fit for it.

I dont want any advice, but any healing words you have would be greatly appreciated. This is my first time writing down everything in detail.     My life is good right now, in nearly ever aspect. I am in the process of repairing my relationship with my family, I have a loving boyfriend and a slowly forming group of friends. I have a well paying job with a supportive company and great coworkers. Compared to where I was two years ago, Im a completely different person.      The last time I thought about dying, about taking my own life, was when I was so crippled by my   and depression that I couldnt leave my bed. I was living on a diet of white bread toast and apples, because that was all I could stomach. Even then, if I ate just a little too much I felt sick to my stomach and it launched me into an exhausting panic attack. I considered there to be no point to living at that point. I was barely living to begin with. My mother and my younger brother were the only thing stopping me, I ruined my relationship with them in the hopes of finally being able to go. But they didnt leave, just continued to take care of me and help me and Im forever grateful and guilty.     A year and a half ago, I had an abortion. I had been with an abusive partner, and when he left me I finally exercised my agency and took control of my life again. It set me back a fair ways in terms of my recovery, which had been going well up until that point. I was wracked with guilt over the decision, a decision that I whole-heartedly support other women making, but when it came to my own experience it nearly killed my spirit. I had my familys support, thank God. I dont know how I would have coped without it.     My current partner, whose name I will redact, is the love of my life. Its cheesy and corny (yum) but its incredibly true. Im able to be un-apologetically myself around him, Ive never felt so deeply loved in my life, other than by my own family. He understands what it means when I say Im having a bad day, I understand what he means when he says he needs one of my hugs. Hes had his own share of struggles, which he has opened up to me about in small ways that I am so appreciative of. Knowing I can help him in any way is strangely healing.   We had to deal with some tough times very recently, and I pray to God that we will see the other side of it. We made a stupid mistake, and I got pregnant. So last week he took me to a clinic and I had a surgical abortion. It was different to my last visit. I had him to greet me when I came out of the recovery room. He wrapped me in his arms and kissed my forehead and I didnt feel alone. I couldnt come clean to my family, about what I was doing that day. Not after last time.   Now, a week later, Im dealing with the bleeding and the mood swings and sadly I dont have him here to hold me (hes been away visiting family) so Ive had to practice self-care. Which I have never been very good at. I feel anxious and restless, and deeply sad.      Just after speaking on the phone to my mother; wherein I complained about feeling this way, she brushed it off as just ""Time of the Month"" and that I should get outside and ""do something"". I think shes forgotten how harmful phrases like ""just move on, dont let it bother you"" can be. After I hung up the phone, the thought of just running a bath and letting my life slip away using whatever method I deem convenient. As soon as the thought crossed my mind I regretted it.

I guess the main point is, my stress went from one area to another area that I’ve never even worried about before this week.

1921,RishiAppleson,1.0,A big pile of mess that I call my brain.,"I dont know where I should be posting this, but I thought this subreddit is the best option.  I posted something on  recently, and one comment told me to go to  but I dont think thats the best subreddit for my situation.  They also told me to go see a doctor but I dont really see the point why.  And now Im battling with my brain if I should delete that post or not.  Anyway.  My brain has been a huge mess for a long time now and nothings making sense anymore.  I overthink a lot, I worry a lot, Im really self conscious about everything and sometimes I dont even understand whats going on anymore.  I feel like whatever I do or say right now is being recorded and then one day it will be used against me.     And then lately Ive been having ""Evil thoughts"" in my head that for some reason wont get out of my head.  Ive even had this thought about ditching my friends for good and just be alone.  And it kinda upsets me that a huge part of me actually wants to do that.  I only have three friends and theyre the best friends I could ever get.  But then Id start having thoughts about how theyre such a big burden and that I should just leave them one day and forget that Ive ever met them.  I even get thoughts about how I was just using them so I dont feel lonely at all and once I dont need them anymore Ill just forget they ever existed.  But thats not the only problem Im having.  Every time Im around a huge crowd I always get the feeling that everyone is staring at me and judging my every move. But then Ill look around to find that no ones really looking at me.  And it only takes one person approaching me to ask me something to make my heart beat really fast and send my brain into panic mode.     And then there are also moments where I would be in a bad mood all of a sudden and when someone tries to talk to me Ill snap and be rude to them and then regret it later on and think about how that person is going to hate me forever.  And for some reason when my environment gets really noisy I would get all moody and start throwing a tantrum like slamming my notebook so hard on the table or closing the door with such force itll make a huge thud.     And then theres my grades.  One time Ill care about them, and then the next its like it doesnt matter.  I also have procrastination issues.  When I had this project due in two weeks I was so confident that Ill be able to finish it one day.  And then the day before the deadline my friends would tell me that I should do it already so Ill be forced to do it.  But then Ill just do half of it and rely on finishing it tomorrow, the deadline.  The deadline would come and everyone would start passing the project and my friends would give me worried glances.  At that time Im pretty sure Im filled with so much regret and resentment to myself.  But then all of a sudden something would click in my brain and then the thought of not passing my project doesnt bother me anymore.     Lately Ive been reading articles about   disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and sometimes I cant help but think that its ""a great idea"" if I were to really have   or OCD.  Its one of those evil thoughts where its like its a bad idea but to my brain would sound really appealing.  Its like my brain wants me to suffer or something, and its a good thing for me to have OCD or  .  And a nagging afterthought about how if I have a disorder I could use it to play the victim and that people would start taking pity on me and everyone will suddenly start caring.  It scared me because it feels like its a cry for attention.     Lastly, that confession I posted on  , I was supposed to delete that already but then I read the comments, and then theres the silver award thing and for some reason it made me not do it.  It made me not delete it and I dont know why.  A part of me is telling me to delete it but then another part of me says, ""No, keep it there.""     So yeah, I just came here to share all my issues because I just cant keep it in and theres really no where else I could share this but here.     Please dont hate me.  Bye.     P.S Typing this post took me an hour and a half because I kept on rewriting, removing, and adding stuff and Im really considering just saving this to draft.

It doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t work that way, but that is what I felt was the best decision. Heck I even flipped a coin to confirm my decision. That because I was so negative in discussing my fears and anger relating to politics in an informative discussion that I was so afraid that my car would break down on the way home triggering another panic attack because of that and expensive repairs.

I got a dog two days ago all on my own and it’s been wonderful. But the day I brought him home my dads girlfriend is telling me more about my family and my mom. It’s been rough I had a severe panic attack yesterday and tried to contact my sister but couldn’t.  My sister (31) and her daughter (6) is being kicked out of my mothers house with no where to live and my sister is trying to pay for living and whatnot however no way to do it. She asked my dad and brother (30) to borrow money but both said no.  I later figure out my dad said no as his financial situation isn’t looking good. He’s not going bankrupt by any means but it’s not good. Last year he had an aneurism and it caused his finances to take a hit. He has to give my mom (divorced) $27,000 next month as part of the agreement. He gives her $2900 a month and it’s finally he decreased considering me and my twin (20) don’t live there anymore. I’m trying to convince my younger sister (17) to move in with me and my dad but she won’t as she (and me and my other siblings hence my   problems) were emotional abused by my dad. She suffered more than I did.  I learned my mom essentially used us a pawns and may not care. I don’t know. I’m very confused and anxious and it’s been a long day and I just need to vent.

I had reapplied and because of this, they want to make sure that I am eligible for re-hire so she calls me back later in the afternoon and tells me that all is good. Basically as long as I dont act like a moron (which I wont) I have the job. They are hiring EVERYONE right now. Its a good job, set down and basically flipping through papers all day. I get to take my mp3 player and listen to music all day/night whichever shift I will be on. I will find all the information out Thursday.   Thing is, I havent worked since this job and I am scared to death. Not about the job itself, but the people. Oh the people. Back when I worked there before, a girl rode in with me and she was my rock. She wouldnt let a soul pick on me, because they did pick on me after seeing me have a panic attack in the workroom one night. She isnt there anymore. I know I will be fine, but my goodness I am nervous. I am not nervous about the actual job, the interview but just new people.   One thing I guess will help is my old supervisor is still there and she knows my situation. I am hoping that might help me a little because she used to make small exceptions for me, basically when they got a wild hair up their butt and moved everyone around. She wouldnt move me. She would leave me where I was, and move the people around me. I never bother anyone anyways. I am going to talk to my Dr Friday and see if we might can dial up the medication a bit, since this is a scary situation for me.   I know it looks bad, 40 year old woman cant even work a simple job without having panic attacks but I just cant help it. I wish I could, I really wish I wasnt like this at all.

1962,yezalicious,1.0,Ive been getting sinking feeling/anxiety attacks from overthinking. Please help.,"This is a veery long post, but I’ve decided to reach out to reddit as a last resort, hoping to find help.   I don’t know where to post this so i figured it fits best in this subreddit.  So I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost a year now, and we’ve been living together for most of it.   I don’t know wether Im sensitive or she is rude, but the point is sometimes she says things that I think are rationally sound and safe to say, but trigger a sudden sensation that builds up in my chest and sinks down into my balls, and sometimes its so strong its physically irritating.   I know that she is easily irritable and has been diagnosed with episodic depression when she was young, so we like to have a rule where we talk and not keep anything from one another when it comes to our relationship. This gives us transparency and we are able to understand one another better, but sometimes when she feels annoyed at me for saying something that I thought is fine but isn’t for her, or when she says something that we both think is fine but its low-key not a nice thing to say, I get those attacks.   I don’t know whether to call them   or panic attacks. Whenever they happen I get a surge of worthlessness, and cant sleep (usually they happen when were going to bed) and blame myself and keep overthinking about why did she say this, or why did I say that or why am I feeling this, or what could I have done to prevent this(even if i haven’t done anything), and this has led to a bad habit of me constantly telling her “I’m sorry”.    It sometimes makes me cry to sleep, and if thats the case the following day I become emotionally vulnerable to the most innocent things and have a milder version of the feeling but prolonged for the whole day.    There were times when they were so strong that I used to get up and go to the corner of the room and sit down on the floor and either bite myself or pull my skin in order to feel pain so I can mask the feeling, and usually she’d become aware of it and talk me out of it, and thats when I burst into tears and start babbling nonsense about my worthlessness.  I never had this in my life before I got into this relationship, and I have no history of mental illnesses. This started maybe 4 months into the relationship and it got stronger after month 6 maybe, but after we realized its becoming serious I tried to cope with it and its been less strong.  Whenever it happens and I have the guts to tell her that I’m feeling it, she becomes very compassionate and comforts me until i feel okay, which shows that she really cares about me and about us.  We talk about the feeling from time to time and usually she gets aware of them because i shut myself off, and we are trying to understand what causes them and how to remove them or cope with them.   I came up with a solution once which is to repeat to myself “I am strong” whenever I have it and it has worked, and I’ve learned to recognize the situations in which i’d get hurt so i become less open or “colder” in those situations, but I don’t feel like those are long-term solutions, as i still get the feeling sometimes.   I’ve looked all over the internet trying to understand what it is and I did an   test and it says I have 50%   and 25% depression, whatever that means. I’ve also tried 7 Cups but I didn’t find it helpful at all.   I find it extremely good of a thing to talk about it with my girlfriend, but sometimes she gets hurt by it and I don’t want to hurt her.  I have a very healthy relationship with my parents but I don’t like talking about it with them because most of the time they just tell me that its going to be okay and usually they’re insinuating that I should be going to sleep so I can study and that I should just focus on studying (I am studying abroad in a private school in Oxford) and I understand where they’re coming from because they’re sacrificing a lot just for my education.  This also sometimes brings me stress from pressure, but I figured thats normal and for me it luckily doesn’t happen often.   This sinking feeling has been bugging me for a while now and honestly I just want the feeling to go away. Since I want to become an ER doctor, if I can find any good solution would be great as I will be able to deal or even prevent physician burnout in the future.   I honestly really appreciate anyone that managed to read all of this. Ive never been this open on the internet and Im hoping it will help me. Thank you.

It happens when I’m in charge, doing something different/new situations, overwork myself or from even terrible bosses. I think my first was when I was a orthodontic assistant, the boss was terrible and the coworkers were miserable. It got to the point where I quit and just stayed at my other part time job, which was at Lowe’s. It got worse after my dad passed away and went back to taking medication. I worked at a print shop near me, I enjoyed it and got along with my coworkers and customers but the owners were terrible. So I left there to work as a para for special ED. It was great and I ended up at a great school assigned with a teen, who all I had to do was monitor her on the laptop and help with schoolwork. I got married and became pregnant during that time and everything was going great. Fast forward to when I come back from maternity leave, my student left and eventually had to move sites(schools), my job was contracted through different schools because of daycare and distance to work. So new site I got along with my coworkers and teacher but then the student I was assigned with was aggressive and screaming all the time at me. It burnt me out so much it I lost 12lb from the stress and my face was going numb. I asked my sons daycare if they were hiring. They weren’t but after a few weeks when school was over they hired me. The owner is fantastic and it took awhile but I get along with most of my coworkers, lot of them all seemed unhappy. The pay is low, there is no benefits but I didn’t care because I was taking care of babies everyday as a assistant. I have been there for almost 2 years and my   and depression is coming back. The daycare has been growing so now I’m by myself in another room with some difficult babies, it has been burning me out. I didn’t notice until my husband was complaining about my job, we can’t afford for me to work there. My last job paid for half the mortgage, student loans, all of daycare and groceries. Now I’m lucky if I can pay any of my mortgage and loans. Being broke and working this hard isn’t making this job worth it anymore, plus the children I’m with scream louder than any child I’ve ever heard. I hate the shift changes and it Doesn’t make me want another child anymore. And I’m also miserable I’m sick all the time, like I’m a regular with the ENT because of my new sinusitis diagnosis. I applied to a factory job and the thought of going somewhere new makes me hate the job I have now. I feel like I’m never going to be happy finding a job I won’t have   attacks over.

Then about how I had forgotten to wish her luck teaching a course and being evaluated on it tomorrow. This spiraled into worrying that shed call and cancel our next appointment because she naturally she must be put off by my rudeness, right? Of course, it really was only genuine forgetfulness on my part, as I was in my head a bit too much by the end of the session.   Ive spent most of tonight talking myself down with reminders that  nobody would cancel an appointment due to such trivial non-offenses.

1995,Dylankempton,1.0,If your desperate and cant get the negative thoughts out of your head this should help..,"**A little bit about me but you can skip it if you want.**  I have PTSD and have suffered narcissistic abuse and neglect. I had a destructive childhood. I started to have panic attacks when I was 9, from 12 I started suffering with severe OCD, severe Social   and severe Depression. My mother is a narcissist, she didnt help me but instead was emotionally and physically abusive, later I developed severe health   too. I helped my self, Im 35, I have a business turning over £400,000 a year a beautiful wife and two kids, you dont get over it but you learn to reduce it and live with it. Theres a trick below that works for me especially well. Anway…  **Firstly simple lifestyle changes that lower the intensity of the   and then the trick:**  * Stop drinking caffeine, it makes a huge difference. * Keep an eye on the amount of sugar you are eating,   can get worse as you come down from a sugar high. * Get enough sleep, 6 - 8 hours, if you cant sleep well dont worry about it, do it when you are feeling better and are able too. * Dont eat crap. Your body needs vitamins and minerals, also there is a link between healthy bacteria in your gut and your mental health. You promote the good bacteria and get the vitamins and minerals by eating healthily. Take Omega 3 supplements or have extra virgin Olive Oil with you food. Eat salad and eat a lot of it (daily if you can), mushrooms, cherry tomatos, mixed salad leafs. Personally I hate salad but it can make a big difference, add the Olive Oil and add some balsamic vinegar for flavor. * Exercise, you dont have to go to the gym, do press ups or run up and down the stairs. Set yourself an achievable goal. * If you need a quick immediate break from the   watch tv or porn. * Get therapy, if you think your therapist is a bit shitty they are, move along until you get a good one. * If you catch yourself looking negatively at your reflection in a mirror, smile and tell yourself you are beautiful and clever, be as kind and reassuring to yourself as you would be to your own little child if they were sad. * Its ok to have an off day, everyone does and dealing with this stuff is tough. * Do all of the above or try all of the above for a bit and see if it helps, it should.  **The trick:**  A twist on mindfulness to get you out of the hell of constant unstoppable soul destroying negative thoughts.  Practice mindfulness, the breathing technique one (find a good video on YouTube). As you do you will realize that thoughts are automatic.  You are not your thoughts, you are a separate from them. As a negative thought comes along you take it up, ruminate on it and feel dreadful - but you dont have too.  Now, if there is a negative thought in your head at this moment, hold it. It takes strength but you can, just hold it. Hold it on a single word or part. Hold it there, it feels uncomfortable. Dont you dare think about it, just hold it.  After about 20 seconds generally it will evaporate, but if it hasnt hold it again. You are separate from your thoughts, you have a choice when they come of whether to take them up or not. If they are negative and make you sad then dont.  You cant stop thinking about something but you can pause it, I call it burning it and it works. It really feels like it wont and its uncomfortable but it does work.  If your like me, soon after the first negative thought has fucked off your brain will offer you a new one, repeat the above.  Go see a good therapist and heal the wounds that are causing the  . Kill the bastard in your head thats feeding you the negative thoughts.  You are beautiful you truly are :)",1553555380,1553555381,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b5hxy6/if_your_desperate_and_cant_get_the_negative/,False,False,0.0

The end of all this pointless suffering. But I didnt.   I called the hotline. I got help. I saw a psychologist. Diagnosed me with   and depression. But also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and   who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.  I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. Im no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

2003,miljou,0.0,I (21F) just started Adderall -- Some questions pls,"Heya, I just got started on Adderall IR 10mg up to twice a day she says. I have some side effects that I had questions about/to see if anyone else had similar side effects (or if theres a chance that side effects are only temporary, because I just started. Im gonna talk to my doctor on Friday about it, but I just wanted some reassurance)? But I really dont know what adderall is doing, or at least its not immediately obvious. Like I can feel that it is there, like there is an effect I feel but I dont know how to describe it. Although my boyfriend has said that hes noticed some positive behavior changes, and I am starting to too, now that I think about it. Anyways, Ill make a list cause lists are great, and you tell me what yall think.     **The Good**  * I tidied up my room within 20 minutes yesterday (typically 1+ hours) * My boyfriend says that I seem happier and more motivated to do Things In General™ such as play Destiny for more than 20 minutes without getting bored or upset. * I sat through my first two classes today without moving too much, and without spacing out. * I sat through my therapy appointment without moving too much, although I spaced out. * All of my racing thoughts stopped dead in their tracks.  * Because of the prior, I get REALLY REALLY comfortable when I lay down in my bed, to the point where I could super easily just pass out. * Because of that Ive also been a bit more comfortable with expressing myself in bolder ways (i.e. SPRINGTIME YAY DRESSES) * I have the feeling Im controlling my emotions better, I cant tell though, and I dont wanna say for sure.  * Oh yeah, I can talk to people without being really quiet or spacing out, or like adding an addendum to whatever I just said, mid-sentence, and its been doing LOADS for my self-esteem. Like, I can actually speak up in class in a semi-coherent manner, without stuttering. This is also related to the racing thoughts thing * Did I mention falling asleep is super easy? * I dont clench my teeth anymore (been really bad recently since I had a canker sore \[Im a chronic victim\] and its been difficult to keep my mouth in certain positions)  * **Possibly good**: My boyfriend says that Ive been a bit more shitpost-y/meme-y (his words). I was making fun of Uldren and his sister in Destiny 2 yesterday, because theyre perfect emo. Pretty much anytime he was on the screen talking I would repeat his lines as if he were one of the scene kids in my middle school.   **The Bad**  * HEADACHES OH GOD * The headaches arent that bad, its just something Im not used to having. Like, I just ate and it seems to have disappeared so Im thinking Im like low on some kind of vital micro nutrient. * Ive read threads here on adderall headaches and a lot of people mention staying hydrated and for the past hour Ive been drinking this Advanced Electrolyte Powerade™ or whatever and I think that thats reduced it somewhat. At least, its not as bad as it was yesterday (it was worse yesterday and is better today, hopefully its just caffeine withdrawal + my body adjusting, but Im gonna go get my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy tomorrow to make sure.) * If it wears off in class like it did today in my last class, my inability to not move becomes so much more noticeable/worse. Like it suddenly just went poof during the last 20 minutes of my 80 minute lecture and all I could do was a;lkfja;slkdfjadkjfhaldfkjasdfjl.  * Night sweats? Is this a dehydration thing? I woke up this morning way sweatier than normal. Part of me thinks that it may be that I turned up the heater a few degrees to high yesterday out of dumbness, but I dont know. Was definitely sweaty. * I can sort of ""feel"" adderall there * Like, in the sense that I have like that feeling in my brain that I have taken a mind altering substance, right? Like its very similar to when I did pot the first time when I was younger, but maybe a bit harsher cause of the headache too. Does anyone else experience this? Is this the ""euphoria""? Cause if it is, Im not much of a fan. Does it go away?  * Some neck/jaw tension? Like Its not like I feel like Im super straining my muscles or anything but I do kind need to roll my neck and massage under my cheekbones every 4 ish hours to relieve some perceived stress.     My questions are mainly around what your side effects were when you first started/do I seem like Im on the right track? My boyfriend seems to think so, I feel a bit guilty for feeling okay/somewhat better on adderall, but thats because theres a LOT of drug abuse in my family so Ive sorta become really averse to ""liking"" things like that (I barely drink alcohol, even though I enjoy it because I dont wanna be like my mom, for example).  Other main question is, is the headache normal? It seems when Im like moving around or paying attention to something (such as writing this post right now) or if Im moving around, it just kinda moves into the background. Is it something to be worried about or is it just one of those things that happens to some people? My main concern is if anyone notices anything I should absolutely talk to my doctor about, and what is worth chocking down to ""normal experience, typically not indicative of anything that requires emergency care.""  tytyty &lt;3",1554339377,1554339378,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b967vk/i_21f_just_started_adderall_some_questions_pls/,False,False,1.0
2004,Chrischticks,0.0,Untreated ADHD at 20 years old,"Spent most of my life as the class clown and the attention seeker. As a kid my parents constantly told me to ""slow down"" because I would be running in circles or being absolutely, hilariously, ridiculous. At one point of my life my family loved seeing me at events because I was so ridiculous and caused a lot of laughter. During this time teachers would tell me to calm down and tell my parents how high strung I was.  After being this hyper throughout my life I had countless friends because I was so care-free (I could never judge people for being weird because I was...weird also?) and therefore made friends with every and anyone from popular kids to kids that werent ""the coolest"". I had absolutely no judgement at all, being the ridiculous character that I was. During this time teachers would tell me to stop talking to classmates and sit still in class... but I never got in trouble due to working my charm as much as possible. Grades were fine, but couldve been better.  Highschool started and I was taking advanced classes but was doing average. I was smart but I KNOW I was smarter. My dad kept telling me I could do better if I applied myself. What a thing to hear. This happened every year of highschool... but I literally could not focus. It hurt my brain to focus in math and school become overwhelming. Flash to junior year when I thought it was   and depression. Lost all of my personality and hyperness, I had no idea what shell of a man I was during this time. Saw a therapist and he treated me for General   and depression and it worked - but I still couldnt focus. Was a real hard time.  Now to sophomore year of college. I cant remember shit! I have no recollection of events with my friends (countless vacations and music festivals wiped from my head). It got scary and frustrating.... was I losing my mind? No. After a year of manic depression and   my parents stepped up (god I love them so much for this) and got me any and all the help I need. Just got diagnosed with untreated   and start medication friday. I feel like Im just starting life?

2007,_troubled_,0.0,I sabotaged everything and am regressing. Again.,"So I have to get these thoughts out of my head. Basically towards the end of last year, I started seeing a psychiatrist and pursuing an   evaluation; in January, I was prescribed Concerta,had the dosage increased after a month, and was given two prescriptions for the next two months, after which Id follow up with my psychiatrist. I was also supposed to get started with psychotherapy but naturally I managed to avoid doing so for two months.  Unfortunately, I somehow convinced myself that the medication was causing more harm than good, so I stopped taking it, and regressed to my old habits of drugs and alcohol (how logical, right?).   Additionally, I have to pass urine lab drug tests/screens to make sure Im not using illegal substances in order to receive prescriptions for controlled substances (Concerta in my case). Also, my psychiatrist is seemingly unwilling to consider vyvanse or adderall, as she was very resistant to increase my Concerta dosage from 27 to 36mg.   My last appointment was on Monday, but I missed it, and Ive been hesitant to call and schedule a new appointment. Ive been interested in possibly trying wellbutrin and seeing how that works for me, and possibly implementing stimulants again when I can pass a drug test in the future.   Ive also considered finding a different psychiatrist that doesnt have to adhere to the aforementioned strict policies on controlled substances, but I do like my psych and would prefer to stay with her.

Now my doctor wants me to take 80mg of vyvanse (1 50mg pill and 1 30mg pill) PLUS 15mg of dexedrine in the afternoon. Keep in mind I’ve only been on stimulants for a little over a month. I wanted to switch to adderall because I feel like I could achieve desired goals of the medication with adderall dosing 2-3 times daily on a medium dose. I know the highest approved dose for vyvanse is 70mg, so it really really worries me that my psych wants me to take 80mg of vyvanse in the morning + 15mg of dexedrine in the afternoon. Not only that, but one bottle of vyvanse for me is 85$, so If I do this I would be paying $170 a month for vyvanse + 10$ for the dextroamphetamine.

The book I am reading is about Character Traits and is done by a Ph.D. holding clinical psychologist (I will not be giving the name) and while she has more experience on the subject than I do I still find myself angry that she portrays prepubescent children with   as talking too much, constantly losing things, and all around unable to function without someone watching them at all times.  I dont blame her for using the language and like I said Im in a good place but Im writing this for those that are just getting diagnosed or even those that are much younger than you.  There is nothing fundamentally wrong with you. Youre different, yes but that doesnt mean it is a bad thing.   Things I have said to the above statements:  You talk too much: I ask questions to continue to understand and to show you and myself I am still paying attention.  Youre constantly losing things: I have never lost anything, only temporarily misplaced something.  You need to find someone to take care of you (Ive heard this from loved ones): If you are conscious about how your brain works and are working on it then no you dont. You are taking care of yourself.

Was to psychologist which I was referred to GP. Psychologist didn’t help, made it worse. I felt so lost, I asked for antidepressants. GP put me on Escitalopram, I stooped being fixated on some things, but depression didn’t improve much, not even with the dose increase. My studies were awful, could not focus or concentrate, barely passed exams. Memory decreased badly as well as cognition compared to what I was before, even when depressed. Addressed with this issues to GP. She increased Escitalopram. I insisted my memory went down because of ADs, she said it is because of depression. False.  I remember, I desperately asked “do you have something for my focus? I cannot make myself do anything and my memory is also bad, and 0 focus”. She laughed it off saying “Yes there are amphetamines”. (I didn’t know what they are used for, only knew it is a drug). I asked “could you prescribe me them?”, on what she said “No, it would be CHEATING”.  With all the symptomatics I was only treated with the drug which was not fit for me only against of depression,   was never mentioned by her ever. “Cheating”.

2030,aequusnox,0.0,The battle to find natural ways to remedy your ADD.,"Its tough. The three most effective things Ive found are:  1) Loads of caffeine. Pure caffeine is better than anything else. The only carbonated beverage I drink is beer so I only acquire caffeine from coffee, dark chocolate, and pressed caffeine tablets.   * Coffee is amazing, but more ""stimulating"" for me than the other two. Dont get me wrong, I could still fall asleep on a pot of the stuff, but I can also be a normal person.  * Dark chocolate doesnt do shit to me, I just like eating it. I usually eat 90% dark chocolate.   * Pressed caffeine. The most effective. Its VERY sedating. Like, the more I take, the less energetic I am. Its the most calming form of caffeine intake for me and the most similar to actual prescription stimulants. Unlike coffee, I tend to become a bit of a zombie on the stuff.  2) Lots of fat and very little sugar. When I fill my diet with high fat foods and reduce my sugar intake, I am much better at managing my thoughts and attention.  3) Loads of exercise. Unfortunately, intense cardio requires a lot of practice. Since I have ADD, consistency isnt my forte and practice generally disappears after 2 weeks.

For instance, the thought of just going through the motions stresses me out: balancing school, work, sleep, nutrition, working out, boyfriend, friends and family. I always find myself dropping at least one or two.   For example: I dropped my boyfriend one time in the past because I thought I couldn’t focus on anything else but him. I have dropped many friends to focus on school. I left my summer job because I thought it was affecting my working out and nutrition. It’s like everything all at once, I can’t handle.   The thing is, I actually CAN and DO handle these things well. I got good/ decent grades, good friends, good relationships, everyday workouts, ETC. but it’s like my brain just *thinks* it’s too much to handle.

I was taking 10mg of short-acting Ritalin for about a month with mixed results, and then finally at the beginning of March, I was able to switch over to an official prescription of about 18mg of Ritalin LA per day. I didnt feel much after the first few days, so I bumped it up to 36mg daily and had a fantastic, productive time. My psychiatrist told me to experiment a bit with dosages and report back, so I told him about my increased daily dose and it all seemed okay.  Of course, it *was* good until I ran out. I talked to my psych again to refill but since it was initially for 18mg daily (not 36mg), Im not due for refill for another week or so. My psych also told me he sent a prescription of 5mg short-acting pills to pick up immediately and use until then.  I went to CVS yesterday and was told I could pick up neither prescription. I told the pharmacist about the new 5mg one as well as the 18mg one. He rejected me for both and said to come back next week. I went home dejected and without meds. So here I am today, unmedicated and with a boatload of midterm papers to write this week because Im a college student. I left my psych a voicemail about it but he hasnt answered.

For instance, according to the English translation provided by Barkley and Peters, Weikard stated that:  An inattentive person wont remark anything but will be shallow everywhere. He studies his matters only superficially; his judgements are erroneous and he misconceives the worth of things because he does not spend enough time and patience to search a matter individually or by the piece with the adequate accuracy. Such people only hear half of everything; they memorize or inform only half of it or do it in a messy manner. According to a proverb they generally know a little bit of all and nothing of the whole…. They are mostly reckless, often copious considering imprudent projects, but they are also most inconstant in execution. They treat everything in a light manner since they are not attentive enough to feel denigration or disadvantages.[3]  According to Weikard, the treatment recommended was:  The inattentive person is to be separated from the noise or any other objects; he is to be kept solitary, in the dark, when he is too active. The easily agile fibres are to be fixated by rubbing, cold baths, steel powder, cinchona, mineral waters, horseback riding, and gymnastic exercises.[3]”   Found this on Wikipedia  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder",1554317371,1554317559,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b91z1k/i_felt_personally_attacked_reading_this_guys/,False,False,1.0

I worked really hard at that job, putting a lot of mental energy into the success of the company and once I got everything in a good place they decided they could do more with less. It definitely messed with my head and my heart. Now my ADD is so bad from   and dealing with the loss. There is so much pressure for me to land the next job soon. I was the sole income for my family of five and frankly I don’t have a clue what I want to do now. And my ADD is making it so hard to think clearly. I’ll catch myself thinking I should put some music on and then realize I’m already listening to music. Or I’ll start a job application and hit one road bump and then get distracted and never apply. I owe a letter of recommendation to one of my employees who was also let go and he asked me a week and a half ago for it. It’s such a simple request and I haven’t done it because my laptop is a pain to get it to charge. My brain won’t shut down at night and my dreams are just expressions of what I’m worried about. Normally when it gets bad I’d talk to my doctor about trying some different medications (only on anti-  stuff now). But with the lay off we lost insurance and I can’t afford to go to the doctor. I’ve done very little these last couple weeks and each thing took a lot of effort. I tell myself to use this time to get in better shape, work on projects in the house but at the end I’ve done nothing. And the stuff I do wears me out. I had an in person interview on Monday and afterwards was exhausted. I wish I could switch places with my husband who has been the stay at home parent since our oldest was born. But he doesn’t think he can find a job that pays enough and frankly I don’t see him trying to find one.  I would just like for once to let someone take control so I can focus on healing my brain.

Now for the more serious part of the post.**  &amp;nbsp;  Over the past decade I have attempted to implement all manner of solutions to get stuff done.   Every new idea worked for a while but was ultimately derailed by my  .      &amp;nbsp;    This idea however tackles several   specific problems that other ""normal"" solutions cannot.    1. **Memory**   Lists are great but when you lose or forget about your list what good does it do?   You cant lose your list if it is strapped to your wrist.  2. **Physical / Visual Feedback**   Alarms and phone reminders are easily dismissed.   With this solution you can see and feel it.   You always know it is there so it is a constant reminder that you need to do something.   I really dislike paper wrist bands on my wrist so, for me, its even more motivation to get my task done so that I can take it off.  3. **Motivation / Commitment**   The desire to take off the wrist band is motivating.   Ripping it off after completing the task feels so much more rewarding than checking off a box on paper or in some app.   When I put one on I am committing to myself to do the task before taking it off.   This feels so much more real than just writing it down.       &amp;nbsp;    ## **Conclusion**   I hope this idea helps you all as much as it has helped me so far.

My doctor also told me that he cant prescribe me ""  medication"" because it may trigger manic episodes, so he would prefer to try and treat the bipolar and hope that it also eases some of my   symptoms as well.  This has been a period of titrating onto mood stabilizers, hoping that they eventually work.  This tanked my schoolwork this semester, but I was able to pull through in three out of four of my classes.  I used my current disability accommodations and even requested new ones as I began to figure out what having   meant for me academically.  I was kind of in the dark, and it showed.     The class that Im tanking is one that is a pre-requisite for a class I need to graduate next semester.  My professor explained that there was nothing I could do to pass at this point.  Im devastated - this jeopardizes my chances of getting a job offer at the end of my internship this summer.  It would mean that I would have to stay behind an entire semester to take ONE class.       I have struggled a lot in college.  I have parents with rampant mental illnesses.  I had to work full time during my first two years at community college to help support my family.  I work two jobs currently that better my school community, and have been on the executive board for two organizations.  I have worked my ass off despite having undiagnosed   and bipolar, and would be devastated if discovering medication that has now changed my LIFE came too late for me to graduate on time.

Also this is kind of a venting cuz i dont have anyone who knows about  .    tl;dr at bottom.    Ok so, i have this thing called gender dysphoria which means i dont like my maleness(it makes me depressive), and feeling like female gives me happiness(stimulation). This is pretty much eli5 of gender dysphoria.    What does it have to do with  ?  Well as i said feeling feminine makes me happy. And i can feel feminine or be a woman by transitioning. This takes lot of time and dedication. But obviously i didnt do this kind of thing until recently even if i wanted to do it 4 years ago. Why you ask? Well because listening to music while daydreaming about being a girl was so stimulating that i  literally did nothing for 2 years other than playing games where i can be a girl or daydreaming about being a girl (pretty much became a neet).     Now that im passing(which means getting read as the desired gender) a little , what i like to do is literally stare at the mirror and do stupid shit because looking like a girl is way more interesting than the shit i have to do if i wanna live a good life. Like brushing my teeth! Which i literally never did until 5 months ago when i started going to dentist cuz my mouth was all kinds of fucked up because of not brushing my teeth.     Well i talked a lot about girl stuff. Now i wanna talk about other experiences.      My room is generally messy but i looks clean cuz i pile all my stuff in my closed and drawers.I literally forgot 5-6(all of them unfinished) packages of nutella in my closet for fucking years. And no mom it wasnt because i was lazy. I  forgot them there like who the fuck would leave them there?    I never did homework on schedule, i never got to school without forgotten books/pencils. I would only doodle sketches in the class because i would get distracted if i didnt doodle. I would always make list of what i should do, i knew how to get good grades but i never sticked to my plans.     I cant stay still when im supposed to be just chillin or listening to music, i move my legs i play imaginary piano or some shit lol. I hate people who talk slow or stuff that progress slowly.     I forget about basic hygene sometimes even though i check my shit when im going out, ill go out and suddenly remember a basic hygene thing i shouldve done and it shits on my day right there and gives me  .    I dont have a name for this but i will notice movement of people(?) Things like sudden mood change or if somebody moves their stuff. I will get really offended and lose my cool if people talk in a slightly shitty manner.     I cant choose a career cuz i wanna do EVERYTHING.

2112,thegman987,0.0,What Does Generic Adderall IR feel significantly worse than name-brand Adderall XR?,"Im not sure if generic vs name brand has anything to do with it as I think name-brands tend to be better tested and Im sure inactive ingredients play some kind of role in feeling/effect but  Ive recently started taking generic Adderall IR in addition to my name-brand Adderall XR and I dont know if its because my poor old brain is just out of dopamine and being forced to produce more than its used to or if IR is just so much worse. With my XR, it normally seems to kick in to full effect after 2 hours and while I dont take it for the high, its usually a pretty good feeling, nice, fun high and the way to the peak is gradual and I never even notice when it stops working. With the IR, the high feels really cheap and sh\*\*ty. It feels similar to a headache although it isnt a headache, and (I know most people wont understand this) but its like someone is pulling on a piece of my brain or something. I guess its still ""a high,"" its just \*extremely artificial\* and \*cheap\* feeling and not one I would have for fun. I also stop feeling the effects relatively quickly (\~4 hours). I didnt just want to increase my XR dosage because I wake up late on weekends and didnt want to get insomnia from it and I didnt want to take more adderall than I needed to, but I might just increase my XR dosage anyway after this IR runs out.     Because the high isnt as pleasant though, Ill give credit where its due and say the IR does make me more likely to do work and not just mess around looking for immediate pleasures, but that could just be because of the increased dosage in general.",1554312352,1554312416,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b90wsl/what_does_generic_adderall_ir_feel_significantly/,False,False,1.0

I was on vyvanse 50mg for a while, got tired of being so hyper focused I couldn’t socialize or enjoy humour so doc put me on Adderall XR 20mg. That sucked because apparently Adderall reacts to your gastric pH and so releases slower/faster based on what you eat (vyvanse doesn’t).  Solution was to give me 40s and 10s. So I tried 40s and 50 again but they have felt less effective than before. My thoughts are more ordered and structured than on Adderall and even more so than before this happened (when I was taking 50s). I don’t feel the vyvanse hit me until an hour later now, and no side effects I used to have from the initial hit like noticeable heart rate increase initially. Also on Adderall I would get fed up with work around 6 or 7 unlike before when I could go till 11 (but had insomnia). Now I can sleep but I still get a strong urge that I can’t continue at 6 or 7 pm.   I was wondering if anyone had this sort of experience? Is it likely from tolerance increase? I’ve read that Adderall has more of the active ingredients than vyvanse so maybe it works less now. I can’t slow down because this has caused me to fall so behind in my work that I risk failing if I do not turn in 2 or 3 assignments by Friday. Today I am testing the tolerance issue by seeing if 60mg will help. I feel that my doctor would recommend trying that if I need to work and am unable to with the current dose, but I really don’t want to.

2163,bibibackstreetboy,0.0,Lead to believe I might have AD(H)D and my parent's are making me feel like I'm ridiculous.,"Hi  Im not really too sure where to start with my recent worries. Some info about me though: 17M, skipped a grade, and started college two years early. Im ""gifted"" according to the school system and finishing high school just next month, but Ive had questionable attention issues since kindergarten that Im now trying to understand more. Ive been debating about writing this post for the last two weeks and I know theres still so much on my mind that I cant put into words.  Ive always had issues with doing what I need to do. In kindergarten I had my mom get called in because I was procrastinating in class. As soon as the teacher said the work shouldve been done soon, Id finally start and get it all done perfectly. That teacher actually suggested I get tested for some kind of learning disability, but my mother waved it off since I was still getting my work done. In first grade I got an IQ test and became(?) gifted, which was essentially just me leaving class early once a week to fool around with other similar students. Every teacher Ive had says Im a joy to have in class and that I was never one to act up, but Ive also had every teacher tell me how I just needed to *slow down* so Id stop making silly mistakes.  School was *so* easy though! Id have homework turned in early because the teacher was going so slow and everything just made sense. Rinse and repeat until middle school where Id get multiple assignments from multiple classes and now my average bedtime became closer to midnight. Not because it was hard, but just because I didnt ""feel ready"" to do it yet.  Even today, school still feels easy but I cant just do something I need to do despite how much I want to unless its due tomorrow. My room hasnt been cleaned in the last few weeks because as much as I desperately want to do it, theres *something* stopping me from starting. After having my parents call me some variation of lazy for the nth time because I didnt do something I should have done earlier in the day, I blew up at them, bringing me close to tears because I felt like they were failing to understand that as much as I knew I shouldve done the thing, I *couldnt*.  So now Im visiting my pediatrician about ADD this Friday, and I feel like trash because what if Im just wasting their time? Am I just lazy? Do I really need to just do it? Am I too smart to have an issue? The nurse I initially saw last week gave me parents forms for them to fill out about symptoms theyve observed, and despite them indirectly pointing them out to me in the past and me telling what Ive experienced, only my mother made an effort to fill out the form and my dad didnt even fill out his form himself, responding to my concerns with the typical ""that sounds like an excuse.""  What should I expect when I meet my doctor when it feels like my parents dont notice or understand any of the things I struggle with? How can I make sure Im explaining what Im experiencing to my doctor sufficiently?  **TLDR:** Gifted high school/college student meeting with doctor later this week. Worried Im just faking it and that I really do need to try harder.

When I decide to pitch in I either sound like an idiot or stay silent because I dont know what to say.      Spelling and conventions are difficult for me, resulting in a lot of humiliating mistakes. Im awful at math as well, despite being interested enough to explore it in my free time. Math classes have mostly been characterized by the information flowing in one ear and out the other. Complete lack of practice probably didnt help.      I constantly feel like an impostor due to the fact that all of my friends are intelligent- to the point where its somewhat intimidating.  I dont understand why the common denominator between the people I jive the best with is that theyre highly gifted while I feel like a brainless wretch most of the time.      I can count the number of times Ive taken my due diligence to space out work for assignments on one hand, so every piece of work Ive produced since high school (Currently a senior in college.) has been completed by the familiar cold-sweat desperation that deadlines generate. Ive somehow pulled off As and Bs from this process, even though I cut my deadlines so close that I dont have time to proofread. Same goes for exams. I remember last semester, I got an 88% on a major exam after reviewing my shitty notes only for a few minutes before the test, which felt somewhat humiliating because of how hard my classmates work to get their well-deserved high scores, while I mostly goof off until my brain hits the panic button.      Despite my apparent ""success"" in most of my classes, I feel like I dont really have any hope for my future. Im going to be graduating with an urban planning degree this August, and I feel wholly unprepared for the job market because of how much Ive slacked off in the past 9 years of my life. Professional planners and graduate students Ive spoken to are total dynamos, with some immediately apparent auto-didactic qualities. They havent slept through work obligations/class or failed to study because they suddenly rediscovered the joy of Minecraft.      I constantly reflect on how much my situation could have been improved if I payed my sweat-equity in a way that allowed the material were learning to incubate beyond the purpose of regurgitating for the test. If I actually worked hard, I feel like I would deserve to not constantly put myself down for being an idiot.

2181,parallellogram,0.0,"Medication feels like i have extra armour in the daily struggle of getting things done, this realization has reduced my procrastination significantly. What other effects have you realized?","So i just started medication (ritaline) a few weeks ago.   I had expected the daily struggle of getting things done to become less severe, so I was surprised that the struggle was still very much there. I was a bit disappointed when the tasks at hand at work still seemed like a tiring hill to climb and was anxious that maybe I didnt have   but just a motivation problem. But after a few days I noticed Im just far less exhausted from doing work, and Im actually getting more done. i still feel like I have to force myself to start the fight, and my adversary is still as strong. Ive just come to realize that Im actually stronger and better protected in this struggle, so its finally a fair fight. I still feel like Im battling, but medication has also given me a piece of armour, so I dont become as wounded whenever I manage to do something.   This realization has also managed to kickstart me more in the morning, because the subconscious   of becoming exhausted before getting started has lessened. Just realizing I have armour motivates me to DO the fight.  Im still discovering everything that is different with medication but not in the way I expected. I havent noticed a lot of impact on my ability to focus when reading articles. I still have a million impulses running through my brain that seem to draw my attention off the text at hand every 15 seconds. I had hoped there would be less impulses and distractions, but clearly thats not what the meds do.   What effect can I expect from meds impact on focus that will give me the same realization to kickstart me better into focusing?",1554286943,1554286945,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b8w5sl/medication_feels_like_i_have_extra_armour_in_the/,False,False,1.0
2182,BadWolf2077,0.0,On Ritalin LA. Is it working as it should?,"Everything is fine for the first couple hours. Then a drop in mood. Before the first couple hours end, I feel like I could get a bachelors, masters, and PhD like this. Then, after those couple hours, I get kinda down, although I still get some boost in concentration, just that it’s lower and I feel kind of exhausted and jittery and anxious. This continues for an hour or two. Then I’m less jittery and anxious and more concentrated the somewhat depressive middle. Is this normal? I’ll give some more details:  I have a cup of coffee after taking it. Read a little more before you condemn the coffee, not everyone is the same. Before taking it I have breakfast. I was taking 40ml LA and 20 IR before. Today switched to 60 LA. The coffee actually helps, but it does increase jitteriness *after* the first couple hours. I took 60 at once. I could try taking the 20 later on instead but I figured this way might be ideal because the problem was with the extended release portion of the Ritalin (read that half of the content is released immediately).  Now I’m 4 hours after taking it. I think it’s stabilized more now. Which is in line with an image I’ve seen online that shows it’s plasma concentration across time, or something like that.

2185,otantatchabur,0.0,"Get a second opinion, or accept it's just anxiety?","Sorry in advance for the length of this post.      I went for an   assessment (UK NHS) last year, and I was told that all my issues stem from  . But I have doubts about their judgement.  I almost definitely do have GAD and social  . But the reasons Im having doubts are:  * In the report write up, they made some basic factual mistakes about things Id told them. * They said that because I did well all through school (even though I couldnt make myself study), I couldnt have problems. They seemed to scoff at the fact I got a 1st at university without studying (I skipped many lectures, and crammed for all the summer exams that all took place at once. I tried very hard to study, but couldnt. Still have nightmares about it) * All my school reports say the same thing: ""does well at school but very quiet"". The teachers didnt know me. Theyd use generic scripts in their reports because they didnt even remember me - they remembered the troublemakers. I didnt put up my hand as I was too terrified. I spent a lot of my time at school drawing. I was ahead of the class in a lot of things, and in primary school we didnt have homework. * They said I didnt physically look like I was hyperactive. At the time I was doused in a blanket of dread and deer-in-the-headlights feeling. Im usually very fidgety, biting nails/cheeks/scratching skin/fiddling with something/wiggling toes, but at that moment I was still with the fear and adrenaline. When Im at home, my boyfriend has to hold my hands down so I dont bite them (and then I bite my lips instead). * To test my inattentiveness, one of them pretended to see a bright neon pink bird outside. I knew immediately what they were trying to do. I awkwardly smiled and didnt look out the window. They took this to show I wasnt easily distracted. I dont think it was a fair test, as I knew it was a test. * I was on SSRIs for about 5 years, maximum dose. It helped with my  , but my  -like symptoms got worse -   used to be the motivator for me not being late, getting work in, etc., but now that motivation was gone. Its what lead me to suspect I might have   in the first place.  The problem is that my school reports dont show any problems, as I was the quiet girl who never spoke a word but still did well. Not sure I could ever be considered for   with these reports. The assessment process was emotionally traumatising (feeling like I was being interrogated/judged, talking a lot about my family, and I guess I took it the wrong way, like I was being told I was stupid for even thinking I might have it).  But Im having problems that are making me depressed. At my job I would spent ages going on tangents researching things on the internet. Doing little projects while I was meant to be working. Not really understanding what was going on because I couldnt pay attention to the discussions. Somehow nobody ever noticed...I guess they just thought I was kinda slow, but I wasnt actually working on my tasks properly. I quit my job because I was so incredibly mind-numbingly bored (2nd job in 3 years). Now Im trying to pursue my hobby as a possible source of income, but I cant make myself even do it. I enjoy doing it, but I just cant. I spent hours researching houseplants, or finding a new todo system for the 100th time, or spending days creating a complicated homescreen calendar widget, or starting to clean the entire house. All the tasks are in my head at once with no ordering or prioritisation and Im completely overwhelmed. But maybe it is  , I just dont know.

2186,Clon3ed,0.0,A life and journey with ADHD. It's a long one,"Hi everyone,  After deciding not to write a blog about my journey with  , I decided I needed a forum to just write my experiences with the hope that someone else can either find something useful in my words, or at least feel that you arent alone.  Ok, so about me. Im a 28 year old Male, living in Australia. I was born and raised in South Africa where I was diagnosed at 12yo with  . This was, unbeknownst to me at the time, the beginning of one hell of a ride with both positive and negative situations... So life basically.  After being prescribed Concerta and taking this for 4 years, I decided that I no longer needed it (rebel or what).  12 years has gone by pretty quickly. I moved countries, started studying, stopped studying, started hobbies, forgot about hobbies, met my person and got married.   I have lived a life that would be considered lucky. Sure its had its challenges and times where Ive felt hopeless and alone, but Ive also had moments of extreme happiness, euphoria and love.   What I didnt know was that my   was impacting my day to day in ways that I just assumed was Just who I am. Some of the issues I faced were common amongst people with  .  - couldnt concentrate for periods longer than 2 minutes  - interrupting people and finishing their sentences for them - forgetting conversations and promises the moment I walk away or end the conversation.. -etc etc etc.  You get the drill   Over this past Christmas period I decided that I needed to get myself sorted so I booked an appointment with my GP to get a referral to a Psychiatrist who specialises in Adult  . With referral in hand (And a month or two procrastinating)  I called and booked my first appointed, a month and 12 days later.  At my first appointment with the psychiatrist, I felt a huge relief after explaining whats been happening and watching his reactions with pure understanding.  He decided to prescribe me with Dexamphetamine. Unfortunately for me at the time, Australia is strict with Schedule 8 drugs (which is good, dont get me wrong), which means in order for my Psychaitrist to actually provide me woth a script he had to get permission from the NSW Ministry of Health. That took 4 weeks.   Yesterday I went back to pick up my script. I have been provided with 10mg three times a day at 6am, 10am and 2pm.   Its now the end of the day after taking my meds for the first full day.  MY LIFE HAS CHANGED. I literally cannot explain the level of clarity and control i had over my thoughts. Previously it felt like I had 500 thoughts floating around fighting for first place but never really hanging around long enough to be thoroughly thought out... but today was different. Today, I still had 500 thoughts but I could pick one and focus entirely. I got so much work done that Id been procrastinating and even managed to schedule a number of projects and meetings Id agreed to but never wrote down.  Im not sure how often Ill post, or even I will again. I just needed somewhere to tell my story.  TL;DR - I finally got my shit sorted and got a prescription for medication to help with  .

2189,ajbrooks192,0.0,I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago. This is what i've learned so far.,"Im treating this more as a consolidation of what Ive learned so far, but if you are fresh off the diagnosis boat, deflated, lost, or any of the above, maybe one or two things I mention will point you in the right direction. Apologies in advance, this is going to be essay length, and Im writing on mobile while at work. Here we go.      1. \*\*You need to break down everything into the smallest steps possible\*\*     Your brain wont naturally just do the thing you need to do. For instance, take this post. I would think ""OK, first unlock your phone. No, dont open Yu Gi Oh, open reddit. Put your thumb over the icon. Dont mindlessly scroll, click the subs tab. Click the   sub. Now click create post"" etc etc.     This is the single most important thing I have learned about  . You need to be your own drill Sargent, left right left right. Most of the time, the only thing stopping you doing something is the first little step. Never read anymore? Literally pick up a book. Open it. Go to the first page. Read the first line. Boom, now you are reading a book. Not everything is as simple as this, but get that snowball rolling down the hill, embrace the power of   momentum.     There was a great post a while back about how   is an executive functioning disorder, not an attention one. Your brain will not do things on its own. You will never clean your room until you break it down to small enough steps that the initial step is do-able.      2. \*\*Virtually nothing in the world feels worse than the feeling of procrastination, regret and hopelessness\*\*     If you are anything like me, I know exactly what needs to be done, I am completely capable of doing it, therefore I dont need to do it right now. ""I could totally clean my room at any point, why bother doing it now?"" Cut to 9 pm Sunday night where you are on episode 10 of a series you started that day, agitated and mincing in your chair, knowing you have done nothing you needed to do this weekend, feeling trapped in your own procrastination.      I have felt a lot of feels in my life, but that one right there might be the worst. Coupled with the night time life regrets. When faced with something you dont wanna do but know you should, like cleaning, going out to see your family and friends, an essay etc - just remind yourself that nothing you could force yourself to do will feel worse than the feelings of regret and restless hopelessness at the tasks being avoided.      3. \*\*If you define yourself by your  , it has already won\*\*      You are not your  . I find myself doing this a lot - ""sorry I didnt remember to get you a birthday present, its my darn  .""      This is unacceptable. You cannot live your life letting the crappy side of you slide by shifting the blame to an uncontrollable variable. Yeah, it probably was due to the   that you forgot that thing, but thats like saying Im late to work at 9 am because there was a lot of traffic. You already know there is going to be a debilitating issue, so using that as an excuse is not acceptable.      We constantly have to fight this battle, every minute of every day. We are stronger and braver than a lot of people in this world, but nobody will ever really understand the issues we face, so we cannot use those issues as an excuse. Understand the issues, and face them head on like an old rival in an over-stylised anime. Do not become your  . Fight it every minute of every day. Sometimes you will win, sometimes you will lose, but never excuse it. Which leads to -     4. \*\*Stop hitting yourself, what are you doing bro, just stop hitting yourself\*\*      Again, if you are like me, you beat yourself up for nearly everything you do. I used to friggin hate myself. Every action I did (or didnt do) would lead to me wondering ""why am I like this, why cant I just, I suck at this, god what is wrong with me why why why""   Obviously, people will tell you ""stop being so hard on yourself, just relax"". This doesnt help, and kind of reinforces the idea of you being useless. Its normal to feel self doubt and be critical of yourself, but we really are too mean to ourselves. Remember that the negatives of the disorder also come with positives; like charisma, a kind and caring nature, being interesting to be around, etc. If you define yourself by your disorder like we talked about earlier, maybe try defining yourself by the positive aspects to alleviate the negative thoughts.      When you do find yourself emotionally hitting yourself, try and take a step back. ""Why am I upset right now? Will I care about this in an hour? Is there a small, easy step I could take to stop feeling this way?"" And most importantly ""would I talk to a family member or friend the way Im talking to myself right now?"" I highly recommend Tim Feriss Ted talk on defining your fears rather than your dreams.       5. \*\*self-care isnt an option, its mandatory\*\*     You feed and water yourself, you have a roof over your head, you shower (sometimes). All mandatory to living. Unfortunately for us, there is much more to vital self care than this. Exercise, meditation, and sleeping 7.5 hours or more are now mandatory. These 3 things help infinitely more than any medication does. Eating healthy helps a lot, too.      The problem is, I dont want to do any of those things. So you have to trick yourself.      \- ""If I walk to and from work today, I can get uber eats for dinner.""      \- ""If I spend 1 minute letting go of my brain strain, and just listening to the sounds of the cars on the street, I can play another round of overwatch.""      Lack of sleep will completely ruin your day and makes everything else you do to help virtually useless. Put your phone on the other side of the room at bed time, put on talk radio to drown out your monkey brain, and focus on the physical feeling of the blanket on your body, the sound of the street, etc. A good trick for meditation is to listen to music and imagine the lyrics playing out literally, imagine you really are walking on sunshine. The point of meditation is to slow down to thinking of one thing at once. Doesnt have to be breathing. You can make it fun! Then reward yourself after.     6. \*\*Medication - it helps, but it has downsides\*\*      Ive been on stimulants for 2 years, and Im still not sure about it. They help with menial tasks, controlling my mood, making me feel good about living life, that kind of stuff. The downside is that they are a stimulant. They make you sweat, lose your appetite, feel anxious, and make you lose a lot of the positive aspects of   like your charisma. You feel extra normie. All of these side effects lessen with time, but I still feel like im on a stimulant every day.     Im not a doctor, so wont say too much about this, but make sure if you do go on stims, get the correct dose. Too much overstimulates, and makes you feel like everything is too much, and you end up sitting on the couch staring at your phone or masturbating. My doctor has suggested antidepressants as well, but I personally declined taking them as I figured it would be too zombie like.  Dont take that as a subtle cue not to try them - A month or two of experimentation could potentially change your life around. I am not an expert in this matter, please do not take any of my points here as gospel.      7. \*\*Addiction - the dark twist ending\*\*      I do not have tips or secrets for this. This is without a doubt the hardest part about   for me, and have struggled with it all my life. Our brains crave dopamine, and will take much greater risks to get that dopamine. Couple that with the incessant need to dampen our monkey minds, and we have a problem.      When I was a kid, it was sugar and videos games. Teenage years brought porn/sex along for the ride. Adult years brought smoking, alcohol and recreational drugs. This is my biggest issue at the moment, and seems to be one the least talked about aspects of our disorder.      I once watched a video about how rats will choose to drink cocaine laced water when alone, but drink pure water when in a hospitable environment surrounded by rat friends. The suggestion was addiction is not a chemical problem, but a social problem. Im not going to sit here and pretend I have the answers to this, it is a struggle that goes beyond  .      I cant figure out is how people of our nature have the ability to turn down easy dopamine rushes, and am concerned for both the path it is leading me down, and the path it will lead others down that are even more lost than me. So please, if anyone chair-mincing champions have any suggestions, share the love below.      8. \*Getting help - the surprise double twist ending\*     I do, however, know how I have survived these years so far. Your family and friends are going to save your life. They are your golden ticket you need to clutch in your sweaty little hands while you run the streets. These cheeky little lights at the end of the long-ass tunnel will surprise and surpass any cliched metaphor for a saviour I can come up with.      Seriously, try trusting in them. If you are anything like me, I physically cant stop helping and taking care of my loved ones. They notice. They care, and they want you to let them in on whats going on in your head. They might not know how to help you directly, but they will be the positive reinforcement often needed when you are festering in your own self doubt and self hatred.      They also help reinforce the idea that ""we fight more battles in our imagination than in real life"". Your problems arent necessarily problems outside of your own head. Ever notice when you go on a date with someone cute, the last thing you are thinking about is a quick dopamine rush? To channel the everlasting songbird Kesha, ""Your love is my drug"". Social interaction is the only true counterpoint in life I have found to dopamine abuse.      If you dont have good friends or family, there are other methods to getting a social hit;  \- Counselors  \- Support Groups  \- Classes/Activities (highly recommend joining a physical class such as a martial art - 2 birds 1 stone)  \- Dating     Of course, you could also try looking inward and deciding whether the burned bridges of the past are at least some-what in relation to your own behaviour. I know I lose most of my friends because I dont make much effort, and just recognising this has help me redirect my path of thoughts in the area.      \*\*Conclusion\*\*     If you just read all of this, congratulations! You just joined the Cool Club. The password is whatever advice or tips you want to share below, any rebuttals or counter-points, any questions or statements. This sub has been nothing but a positive and tangibly beneficial place, full of nothing but support.

2191,scruntled,0.0,Trying to keep from falling into a deep pit of self-loathing,"Ex (29 M) left me (23 F) yesterday.  Again.  He told me that ""the way I behaved/treated him was the worst shit hed ever had to go through in a relationship"".   I asked him if that also included one of his exes cheating on him.   He said ""yeah, because at least that was honest.""  Apparently his ex felt she was unlovable and so she acted destructively because of it, trying to seek out affection in other places that werent him, fucking some other dude.  It dawned on me just a moment ago that he inadvertently excused her behaviour as something she couldnt help. As if she were a helpless victim to her self-esteem, and there was some other hand at play that meant her cheating wasnt entirely her fault.  But I guess according to him, my neurological disorder doesnt count in that regard.  According to him, everything I did was out of apathy or malice, or a lack of love, and that I ""never ever bothered to try"".  For some reason, he thought I could control the way I behaved if I ""wanted to/cared enough"", and choose to be different.  Why is it that he sounded so sympathetic for his ex, but Im the absolute slimiest scum of the earth?  I honestly cant believe it.  I dont know who Im madder at with his assertion: me or him.  That relationship ground my self-esteem to dust and I can feel myself beginning to spiral.

I scored an 81 on the CAARS (Conners Adult   Rating Scale) for my overall score and I scored a 92 for inattentiveness.   The symptoms that I have the hardest time with are: - Having 500 projects started, but never finished, because I become bored. - Hyper-focusing on different things for a short period of time - BORED BORED BORED ALL THE TIME - Being unable to watch movies or TV shows because I can not pay attention to them long enough. When I watch YouTube videos, I have to speed them up 2x their speed in order for me to not lose interest. Otherwise, it takes me 2 hours to watch a 10 min long video because I end up getting distracted by other things.  - Forgetting what I am saying in the middle of what Im saying. - ""word finding"" (not being able to find the words for what I am trying to say. - Talking too fast; my mouth goes faster than my brain and I end up not making any sense because I fuck up what I am saying, or I cant figure out what I am trying to say. - Losing everything, all the time.   The woman that did my testing said that she did not want to diagnose me because I didnt score high enough to give me an   diagnoses, but didnt want to totally rule it out, because I scored high enough to where she doesnt want to say I DONT have it, so she made it a ""rule out"" diagnoses and told me to test again in a year. She will only diagnose someone if its 99 or higher.   The diagnoses for the 5 tests I did (MMPI-2 CAARS, MCMI, IVA-2, and the WAIS-IC) were depression and  .

And Im gonna organize my points into a list so I can remember them.  1. Grades. My grades have been falling due to me forgetting to do homework. I constantly try to remind myself to do said homework, but I keep pushing it off. Like, as Im writing this, I have 2 maps due tomorrow for Honors World History, but I have a field trip tomorrow to a local college, so I can procrastinate on them more. I have a Lab write up in Biology to do, which I didnt do the first part of it, since I was absent that day, and I now have a 61.2 in the class because of that assignment.

And Im about to miss even more assignments due to another school trip Im taking on Friday, and Im getting super stressed about it, yet I cant bring myself to work on it.  2. Getting in trouble for losing a necklace I havent seen in years. For my confirmation, I got a $200 necklace from my family that I was... less than estatic about. I mainly just kept it in the box it came in, other than wearing it to a wedding once. Anyways, I was getting ready to pack for the trip I mentioned earlier, when I couldnt find my wireless earbuds. After searching for a few minutes, I couldnt find the earbuds, so I just announced defeat and sat on the couch. Then my mother went into my room and yelled for me. She was checking one of the drawers in my dresser where I kept random stuff, and had found the empty jewelry box that the necklace was supposed to be in. She started telling me that I lost it, or that I gave it to someone else cause they thought it was cool. (I dont know how that makes sense, but okay) She then brought up the fact that I have an empty Airpod case on the dresser, and that she never bought those for me. I tried to explain to her that I found them on the ground at school, and have been trying to find the person who lost the case in the first place. I was unfortunately drowned out by her telling me to shut up, and that I  gave the necklace which Ive only worn once away. Hell, Id forgot that it even existed until she pulled out the box. But, now shes convinced that I gave it away, and Im currently grounded for a month.  3. I cant just stop and think about what Im gonna say. I often say random things at inappropriate times, or vice versa. Its become so bad, as to the point where multiple people have asked me whether I think before I speak. I never know how to answer them. It feels like I never really have the chance to think out responses, and even when I try, it never comes out like I want it to. Its got me into many fights with my parents, when I think Im being reasonable and civil when I speak, I just get shut down for being, ""rude"" or ""annoying.""

Im 18 now and currently in my second year of college (Year 13 in UK) and over the past two years Ive noticed that my focus has basically completely gone. The meds do definitely make a difference, because when I forget to take them I get extremely fatigued, tearful, talkative, unable to focus on anything for more than about thirty seconds (even focusing my eyes on things is a struggle!) and sometimes depressed.

It feels like even when I try to take initiative, unless its something stimulating or that I can muster up an iota of caring towards, it just doesnt get done. I feel so useless all the time because of it.  Also, to get ahead of this, I do not have accommodations from my school.

I was in college, in a bad marriage at that time, and diagnosed with  . I was trying to do total self- care, so I was put on metformin and levothyroxine at the time from my OBGYN for hypothyroidism and PCOS. My primary doctor put me on anti-depressants as well and filled my   prescription. The cocktail of everything I was on was too much for me. My marriage was falling apart. I went from top student with published research to an attempted suicide in 2015. I was pretty freaked out and quit all medications cold turkey (I know I had other life issues, not just the meds). Left college as a junior, moved back closer to home. Couldnt find a job so I moved back in with my parents and soon found another job.  For the next couple of years I was really depressed. I sorted through my emotions and fears to heal myself. I ate a plant based diet and exercised and lost 60 pounds went to the doctor once and found out I didnt need my thyroid meds anymore. Yo-yod from smoking to vaping and back. I quit smoking cigarettes for good finally last year but not vaping. Im married again, and quite honestly Im very happy with my life!   But not all aspects. Because this   is a looming thing. I cant focus for shit. I forget everything constantly. I cant sit still, and get up and move around every couple of minutes. I sit down to paint a mini figure and now it takes weeks because Im not managing to sit and do it or anything else. Ill pace at home, I paced at work and people told me I looked lost. Still get bouts of depression for no reason. Ill be in the middle of an important conversation or discussion and completely forget my point or what was said or just plain space out. I lose motivation completely for any project that sparks my interest. I can no longer read long texts of information and retain it unless its a fictional novel, I halfway clean the house, and the whole time I have to vape. I know Im addicted to nicotine, and I know how to quit as I did cigarettes. I started vaping again because the mania was too much. I got my energy back after quitting, and it increased 1000 fold. And so did my pacing and moving, and if Im worried then I cant stop moving. My brain feels like its on overload. I have to exercise to the point of exhaustion. I know medicating with nicotine is stupid. Plain stupid. And its been how I coped halfway. But Im done with that now. And Im going to the doctor when I get my tax return this month.   I guess I didnt 100% believe I had  , thought I might be misdiagnosed. I believe it now. And Im scared to go back to the doctor and I know I have to. Im scared because I dont want the meds to change the person my husband knows. I had to forcibly smile even if I was happy when I was last on my meds. Im a light-hearted and smiley person, last time I couldnt fix my face to match my emotions. Its been 5 years since diagnosis, 4 unmedicated. Ive finally decided Im not managing like I thought I was. I turned 27 yesterday and I feel too old to ignore this anymore.  I guess I was wondering if anyone has any words of wisdom or experiences they might share please.  TLDR: Unmedicated for 4 years, thought misdiagnosis, believe it now and worried about taking meds. Feeling pretty stupid and desparate for help.

2242,spyder160,0.0,"Fairly recently diagnosed, confused as to how much ADHD has to do with anxiety/depression...","Hey yall, just wanted to see if Im the only one that feels this way and to vent a bit, Ill put a TL;DR at the end.   Im 22 years old and I got diagnosed with  -PI about six months ago; I lost my dad three years ago, and since then I have been in a hellish cycle of depression,  , and just not wanting to do ANYTHING (from important life tasks to hanging out with friends and anything in between). I started going to a psychiatrist about a year and a half ago, which led to a year full of numerous different meds and antidepressants (none of which helped). I was anxious, scared, and hopeless; I felt like something was just WRONG with me, and without my dads reassuring and motivating presence in my life I just stopped caring about everything. My psychiatrist finally tested me for  , and it appeared that I fit the bill of an  -PI individual to a T. But I had never thought of myself as even potentially having   growing up; I did fairly good in school (though I now realize it was mostly easy for me as I rarely studied), was really well behaved/quiet, and always kind of thought of myself as smart, although different.  Anyways, after diagnosing me my psychiatrist put me on adderall (IR, 20mg daily, now 30mg) and WOW if it didnt work wonders. While I no longer really get a mood boost from it, it just makes my brain work and think like how I would imagine a normal brain does. Im not trapped in my head all day, and can like, go to class without my thoughts and   making it feel like the hardest thing in the world. So it would seem that I do have  -PI, and the adderall definitely seems to help me behaviorally at least.  However, many days I just feel like the   is BS and somethings wrong with me. The more I read this subreddit the less I feel this way, but I still just I dont know want some reassurance. For instance, on the days I dont take my adderall I just get this like existential   which was there before I was diagnosed; the feeling that something is wrong with me, that its WAY too hard for me to feel happy, that the happy person I show my friends is a facade, etc. On top of this is that Im like super sensitive; like if anyone is mean to me or says something disrespectful, I either feel like its completely true and Im worthless or I get insanely angry at that person. The more Im writing the more Im actually feeling like it is my  , I mean these problems all existed before I lost my dad and certainly before I was prescribed adderall, but it just still feels weird. Some family have told me something along the lines of ""of course adderall makes you feel normal, its SPEED"", but I mean I feel like most people wouldnt feel NORMAL on adderall.

It isnt like this person is of sketchy character, rather I know he holds himself and his conduct to high standards. I know the problem is me, and I hate it.      Hes a classic introvert, and Im a classic extro/introvert. We dont hang out outside of class because we both are involved with very different lifestyles at school, so our relationship is really confined to academia. But I feel like Ive known him as a friend for so much longer, and there are people in my own fraternity who I feel are more strangers than he is, even though theyve been to more social events with me. I dont push him to meet up with me for homework when I know hes probably drained, and he doesnt bug me to go to classes with him, or sit next to him, or even walk out of shared classes on routine because he knows how unmotivated I am to go to classes anyways. He never even complains when I show up 20 minutes late every time to other times weve done homework for other classes.      I get that the exam is hard, its stressful, and at the end of the day, everyone needs to do what they think is best for them, but if I can rationalize that why do I still feel hurt and so small by this? I went to my classes today, turned in the assignments I needed to, paid my rent,  ate food, took a nap, took my meds and got ready to meet up with my classmate to study for what I thought was going to be a really fun study session with my friend like we had last night. Now, I just feel crushed, small and insignificant. Also, I feel like this dude straight up robbed me. Im all for sharing content when I can, but am I a terrible person for wanting someone who uses my study materials to also study with me?      Maybe Im too much to put up with. Im incredibly smart, and I know this. When the answer key says to do it this way, I usually try to do it my own way, so I can learn the material better, and regardless of what way I learn it, once I figure it out, Im the guy that walks around explaining it a bunch of different ways to people so they get it too. My friend is the type to doubt himself a lot, so he likes having me around to explain it to him. I just hate that I cant learn like he does, then I wouldnt get distracted so much trying it out a different way and wasting time before I find the ""meta"" way of solving the problem.      Does anyone else have experience with this? What does this look like outside of school? For those of you in project management, do you ever feel like your friends/colleagues in other departments just use you for the way you see things so they can go off and work on their projects on their own? If thats the case Id rather not waste my time convincing employers that Im fit to work with teams; that Im fully capable of producing the quality they expect on my own, without needing a useless team to drag me down.

Im starting a new job next week and will have to start getting up 2 hours earlier than Im used to and am afraid I will sleep through my alarm and be late to work.  Ive googled this a bunch but wanted to get opinions from this sub to see if anyone else has had this problem while taking adderall daily. Im also very brain fogged in the morning but Im more worried about the oversleeping at this point.,1554238944,1554238945,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b8ovq4/how_to_combat_oversleeping_while_on_adderall/,False,False,1.0

Disclaimer, overall I’m a really good test taker, that skill pretty much singlehandedly got me two degrees because I essentially did no homework, so I’m not saying this happens all the time but it has fucked my butt a few times.   Long story short there seems to be this phenomenon where people who struggled in gen chem were good at ochem and vise versa. I struggled with gen chem, although it was back before I got medication and I still managed to pass two classes where 80% of people failed the first time so who knows if I’m actually bad at it. Anyway the last section of the second class was an intro to ochem, i had realized the phenomenon yet but I just grasped the shit so easily and these two girls i was friends with were struggling even though they had a easy time up until then. So I’m like I guess it’s my turn to teach y’all. We studied late all finals week and by that i mean I fucked around until they had a question for me. I’m tell you this so you understand how well I knew this shit and why the end is so bad.   Fast forward to the test I take it and it’s a breeze I’m not worried at all. We’re walking back to the dorms and we were allowed to take home the tests so we were looking over it. We look at the first one and immediately i noticed that I misread the question and got the wrong answer. I’m like oops but whatever I killed this exam. We keep going and I find question after question that after rereading it I instantly knew I fucked up. I got a 57% and the girl that I TAUGHT EVERYTHING SHE KNEW got an 83%. I fuckin cried and I thought I was gonna get kicked out of school because I was already on probation.   Luckily grades shot up once I got medicated though but I’ve still done that a few more times just not nearly as bad.

I even tend to be more emotional.  When I am too sleep deprived, I also give into all of my impulses and mostly do nothing and just feel like death and wait for the moment when I give up pretending to do work and just go to sleep.  But if I sleep just the right amount (like 7 hours), Im sleepy and ""out of it"" but I can stimulant up enough that I can at least somewhat pay attention in class (although I would pay attention better if well-rested), but the real gain is when it comes to homework. Homework becomes just stimulating enough for me to not want to fight it and do other more interesting things and I feel more emotionless (a little dead inside) but probably healthier than being an emotional wreck that jumps down my roommates throats for not being fun and polite enough.      On a side note: anyone think based on this I could use an adderall boost? My psych tried to prescribe me more but I didnt really want to get more dependent on it/get high on it and adderall hasnt really worked all that well since the first week I used adderall.

I have found this INCREDIBLY useful and wanted to share in case others find it useful.      \- I have initiated weekly check-ins with my supervisor. They are about an hour (but could go longer). It sounds like a lot, but she is rarely in the office, so I cant always just stop by her desk to ask her questions. Having this on the calendar is helpful. She finds them helpful too so its not a problem for either of us.   \- Before each meeting, I send her an agenda of what I want to cover. This is a dated document that I have saved in a folder literally titled ""Weekly check-ins."" Whenever something comes up I want to discuss with her, I add it to this list. Sometimes I add notes in the agenda doc if needed.   \- At the meeting, I take the agenda and type my notes in it, including action items. She sometimes also adds agenda items that I type into my document.   \- If there are big projects or tasks I need to do, I generally ask for a due date even if she doesnt provide one. I note that.   \- At the end of the meeting, I take the action items and paste them on a running monthly action-item list. Anything that I can accomplish in under 5 minutes, I do immediately.   \- I look at the agenda from the meeting and decide what needs to stay and be re-visited at the next meeting. I then keep that information in a new document saved in the check-ins folder with the new date.    \- Throughout the week, I continue to fill out the next weeks agenda as needed. I check off my to-do list as I go.  I also keep a clipboard with hard-copy documents she needs to sign or approve... and have started also adding anything to be discussed if it needs a hard-copy paper version and not just to be sent over email. If I have documents specifically for discussion at the next meeting that dont need to ""live"" somewhere else on shared files, I save them in the ""check-in"" folder too so they are easy to pull up at the meeting.      I have also instituted an action-items policy at work with our weekly staff meetings (I am not our executive director, but right under her). Our admin takes notes during the meeting, but keeps a separate section for action-items for each person. At the beginning of each meeting, I take us through them to see what was done and what wasnt. Its not a punitive thing -- just a check-in. Some of the items get a different month added to them or timeframe if they stay on too long and arent urgent. If we start talking about an item for more than 30 seconds, we stop and add it as an agenda item. The action items are done quickly (usually 5 minutes or less) and have made all of us a bit more productive at least.    As with my other system -- if there is an action item assigned to me that I can complete in under 5 minutes, I do it immediately following the meeting. If not, they get added to my running to-do list. I also check the action item list an hour or two before each staff meeting to see if there is anything else I can either get done or at least make progress on before the meeting.

2306,lilacpolaroids,0.0,Concerta giving me headaches and not really working (20F),"So I recently got diagnosed and my phsychiatrist prescribed me concerta 18mg to start off. The thing is that Ive realized that the effects only last like two hours, and then Im back to my normal distracted self. Im getting my drivings license and Im going to the theory class and they have this system that really works for me: the put a stamp every time youre the first to answer a question on your notebook, and by the end of two weeks the one who gets more stamps wins a prize. Also, they give away candy in the end and I have this ""focus throughout most of the class = candy"" thing thats also helping.  Like, Im in class and I start thinking ""Damn, this meds are really working, I havent lost my focus for the past two/hour and a half straight and Im understanding everything.... Wow the teachers got a really weird beard, how did he got it to be like that?..... He looks like a goat. WAIT, no Im supposed to be paying attention -- pays attention for literally two minutes and hears something about difficult curves on the road-- Well, I remember this one road that was really curvy where I saw a bunch of goats. --looks at the teachers beard again -- How?"" and so on   I mean, most of the class Im somehow focused but the class lasts like three hours in a row (which is not good for me) and while I understand most of it, there are A LOT of moments where  get completely lost. Its not as bad as it would be without the meds, but its still there.  Now, this plus the headache that starts by the middle of the class (and lasts all day long) makes me get more distracted for the headache than for the class.   I dont know what to do. Ive only used this meds for like four or five days so I think its too soon to talk to my phsychiatrist about it. Also, my mom thinks Im lying (I havent told her about the headache) about how long the meds last and says that I ""should not rely on my meds and see if I can do things without them"". Ive done this for the past 14 years and it hasnt really gone well (Im 20 rn). Those two hours of attention that Ive put WILLINGLY with concerta are the best Ive ever had right now. Well, this part is sort of a rant so Ill stop now.   Id like to know if any of you has dealt with this? How long do you think I should wait to talk to my psychiatrist?     **TL;DR**: five days on meds (concerta 18mg) and the effects only last up to two hours of class in a row, missing chunks of the class because I get distracted with the teachers beard or the little cars he uses to represent a situation (Im in driving classes). Also, I start to get a headache after an hour and a half of class so it adds on to the distraction. The headache is not really strong, but it lasts all day long (or until I take something for it). I take my meds at nine a.m, more or less and class starts an hour later. Id like to know if any of you has dealt with this? How long do you think I should wait to talk to my psychiatrist?

The person on the other side leave the speaker on. You hear yourself back on the phone. You stagger and lost what you want to say.   On separate occasions, people would make subtle suggestions: ""if you want to stop evil people turn the speaker on. They cant speak."" Or even better, ""If someone is lying or trying to deceive you, they cant hear themselves back"". Or ""Its a reflection therapy. Let them face their own evil"". Aka Dorian Gray, ""This is how you defeat Dorian Gray. Let him face his own evil in his mirror or his voice back in the speaker"". Slightly more chemotherapeutic, ""to defeat Narcissism or excessive self voice or self image"" .  Except, you simply cant continue and finish your line because you lost the train of thought when because you are hearing the echo back from the speaker. It made it even worse since you are already self-aware and anxious for screwing up your previous seemingly regular conversations because you cant stay on topic or disjointed conversations and you are trying to fix it.  Sounds familiar?  Yes, it definitely would invoke my inner evil, the   itself. Something I despite because it screws up so many aspect of your life.   What can I say? It is more evil to me than to you. It destroys me. Not you. I have no intention to lie to you or deceive you in anyway.

I am thinking the word sequence of what to speak next as I am speaking. This is a big problem for me. In fact, it has nothing to do with you. It is my problem I want to fix. Dont invoke it.

My GPA is shit, and I’m graduating from community college in a month. The university I wanted to transfer to rejected me because my GPA wasn’t good enough, and my only shot at getting in is doing really well this semester.   I started stims a couple weeks ago with a new psychiatrist and it’s amazing, it truly is, I’m so grateful to be able to think clearly for the first time in my life. But it’s not good enough to make up for how much I’ve fucked up this semester, and how much I’ve fucked up the last 6 years of community college.   I’ve never really been ashamed of dropping out of high school until now. It was the right choice for me at the time, but not knowing that I needed to be treated for   ruined all the optimism I had for college. I don’t have anywhere to go next semester and the thought of applying to more universities is terrifying. It took so much for me to turn in my application to the first one, and it still wasn’t good enough. The fact that I’ve been doing so much better over the last year than the five before it wasn’t good enough. How the fuck do I explain years and years of nothing but Ws, As, and Fs on my transcript?   TL;DR - every time I think I’m getting better at school, I fuck it up. I’m a high school dropout, and I have nothing to show for my 6 years at community college, and I don’t know if I’ll ever be good enough for a four year school. I’m so frustrated.

But recently Ive stumbled upon some articles about   and they described some problems I always had, that I just always considered part of my personality.  Since I was a child I was always a bit of a daydreamer, but I was always really good in School. When I started an apprenticeship I had huge problems with tasks I considered boring. To the point I was regularly reprimanded by my superiors because I would be really really slow to finish such tasks and the quality of my work would be lacking. I also got worse grades as I did not deem the subjects we had in school interesting enough, but I still got by.  I also always had huge difficulties with procrastination, especially when getting out of Bed. Once I started uni, I started to have better grades again, but the subjects also interested me a lot more, but the procrastination for stuff I did not want to do go worse. It ended up with me having several panic attacks because I procrastinated for way too long. After a few bad experiences I got my s\*\*\* together a little, but a lot of problems still persist. I contrast, I could spend hours on end programming for projects or subjects I was very interested in without being distracted at all. It was almost as if I was consumed by them and if I worked on them to late I could not go to sleep for hours even though I normaly fall asleep within minutes. I could not think of doing everything else. I also started to have increasingly better grades with the options to choose my own subjects approaching the end of my undergrad. For those lectures I never had problems getting up or procrastinating excercises.  But my current work situation does not state office ours and I can basically come in whatever time I want (its the dream). The problem is I cant seem to stick to any schedule if my office ours are not fixed. I always come in way too late and end up having to stay unit late evening to get my hours in, which means I sometimes miss training sessions. I cannot stick to a schedule no matter what I try.  My girlfriend also recently told me shes annoyed by the fact that I always get addicted to things that interest me (sports, TV shows, video games, school or work projects etc.), and cant seem to let them rest for our time together.   Do you think theres the possibility of me having some form of   or would it have to be way worse/with hyperactivity than what I am experiencing and its just part of my personality?

Im not really seeing what my alternatives are- the less criminal ones.       bio:  Im a late college student with adult  , Im returning to school for the 3rd time... Im currently majoring in IT. I actually do like the subject and enjoy it...     Im also enrolled in the university through tuition waiver by my partner because they work for the university... Their policy is that if I fail (D or F) in any coursework, I would have to pay it back. Even if I LOA... Only way to waive it is to take a medical LOA- which I already did two years ago. I cant take out any school loans because it would be for this semester.     Ive been missing a lot of classes - due to procrastination- not finishing homework and didnt want to show up to class and get called out. And not only that, the teacher is someone that I know outside of the school and hes 10 years younger than me. Its more of embarrassment on my part. Hes a good teacher and good kid.     I did meet with the teachers before the spring break, promised to improve, and they asked for doctors note....     Now it;s after spring break, and I dont have doctors note. I do have an old one. Im desperate enough to ""update"" it to cover my arse. But I know this has criminal consequences? I dont know what to do now.  And Can the university professor call the doctor to verify the note? Does that ever happen?     I dont want to give up, and I am actually still catching up on the coursework and doing well. But Im afraid the teachers wont accept it.     TLDR:  Missed lot of university classes, teacher asks for doctors note, dont have one... If I dont pass, I would have to pay more than $10k to remain in school.

The benefit of the list is obviously that you put something on that you arent going to watch right at this second, but intend to later. Fine.  Except what I found is that once something went on the list, it became less likely to ever get watched. It became an oppressive list of reminders of things I hadnt done yet. Seeing the thumbnails of certain movies and series every time I went on Netflix, and then watching something not off my list, made me feel guilty.  Now I cleared the list and decided to try allowing myself just one series and one movie on there - the next things I intend to watch. Maybe I will, maybe I wont. Its a much nicer feeling.  The broader   theme here is that whilst getting things off your mind and into a system can help, it stops helping when the list begins to feel oppressive.

I have this ""friend"", we went to a 6-month boarding school course together a few years back and were practically best friends while we were there. We would tell each other all our personal stuff, hang out constantly, we shared a lot of interests and just generally had a good time together. Weve seen each other a few times since then (We live 3 hours apart), but lately it feels like theyve been avoiding me. Whenever I try to make plans to hang out, they say that theyd love to do that, but then make a vague excuse as to why they cant make any plans right now. We happen to be going to the same cultural festival in a few weeks, so naturally I asked if they wanted to hang out, because I was going there alone. They told me that it would be great to meet up and say hello, but that they were planning on hanging out with some friends, so I shouldnt count on them for company during the festival. I ended up saying that they should just let me know if theyd rather hang out with their other friends and they replied something along the lines of ""yeah, that was my plan"".  So now Im sad and confused and my rejection sensitivity is going crazy. I dont understand why they would keep telling me that it would be great to hang out again, but then when we actually have the opportunity to do so, they dont want me to be included in their group of friends.

My son, 1st grade, attends a really great school. Unfortunately for me, this greatness seems to hinge upon mounds of papers and tasks for parents to deal with each day. On a daily basis, I am supposed to sign his behavior chart, sign graded papers, sign calendar tracking signatures of graded papers, fill out his reading log (that we have to keep up with and remember to turn in every Monday), dictate and check his spelling words, time and check his math facts. All of this must be done between 6:30 when we get home and 7:30 when he begins his bath/bed routine.      Im overwhelmed keeping up with everything in addition to my own work and household responsibilities. I feel like I cant do adulthood and parenting properly, like everyone else has everything under control just fine, but I cant get it together. I dont know what to do. I feel terrible when he loses points because I forgot to do the stupid reading log.  (reading stories every night has been a family ritual since he was a baby--why do I now have to prove to his teacher that we are doing that? The one thing I am actually definitely good at as a parent is now called into question by his teacher???)     I am so tired of getting notes from his teacher that I didnt sign the stuff on the right days, that all these things must be done "" \*every night to ensure his success\* "" when Im barely making it through. We go over the stuff in the car on the way home, its not like Im ignoring his behavior chart. We talk about it daily. I just dont always remember to sign it once we get out of the car because theres dinner to do, animals to care for, chores to do, homework, my own school work to attend to. He will get sent out of class if his socks are the wrong color, so if my evening comes down to prioritizing things, Im putting laundry over signing papers, because even if he loses points, hes still doing the stuff hes supposed and learning the skills he needs.  But when do I even get to try to  have any quality time with my child? Its hard enough since Im always struggling to get the house in order, which cuts into family time.      Theres a woman I go to school with who has like 5 children at the same school as my son, and she manages just fine! How???? Why cant I even pass for a competent adult??     What do I do?? How do I take care of all of these things??  Why arent there accommodations for parents with disabilities??      I wanted to have another child until elementary school started. Now I cant even cope with one childs schooling, and I am feeling defeated, heartbroken, guilty, and like Im a failure.

Do you know what meds and dosages are commonly prescribed for someone her age? She is 11 but she is adult sized.   Also, any tips on how I can help make things easier for her? She is home schooled as her   and depression (and probably  ) made traditional school too difficult for her, so we don’t have to deal with regular school. Most of her struggles revolve around forgetting to do things (even after many reminders) and staying on track/focused.   Thank you so much for your help!

2435,Naps666,0.0,A different point of view on ADHD,"In my opinion, the fact that   is usually seen as an illness comes from our definition of illness, which is invented by us. An illness is usually defined as a difference in our body (including our mind) which causes someone not to function properly in the surrounding environment.     is a difference in our ability to concentrate on tasks that are required by our modern society, which is completely not natural. Humans did not evolve to stay 8-10 hours a day in an office. Some people manage to get through it, while some have problems functioning properly in this kind of environment, for example by having a tendency to use imagination more than usual, which makes focusing on boring tasks a hard thing to do.  Medication is a way for society to make some individuals able to function, but it is nothing else than a drug. I personally take Ritalin, which helps me to do what I must do, but I still think that this is society getting us ""high"" to make us function ""properly"".  I think that the main problem here is that its society that should adapt to people, and not the other way around.

Sexual abuse),"Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right place to post about this kind of stuff... it’s still very fresh and confusing.   My ex partner of 5 years would never take no for an answer, when I’d try to say no to sex for any reason at all (usually they’d ask me after keeping me up all night when I had to work, and was the only one in our relationship with a job) they would have a meltdown... I’m taking screaming, crying, threatening me with various consequences etc.   Eventually they found out they had RSD as a side affect to their  , and told me that they couldn’t contain their anger or outbursts when I’d say no because of that.   Now that I’m away from them and have been for a few months my current therapist seems to agree that they are probably also a narcissist, and what they did to me under the guise of RSD was sexual abuse.   I’m still having a hard time coming to grips with the idea that they sexually abused me. I don’t know if their argument that they only did it because of their RSD is valid or not, I guess I’m just very confused and I’d like to know more about their actions from other (hopefully much nicer) people who may also have RSD.   Two of my   friends who also have RSD have told me that their actions weren’t justified in the least, and that sexual abuse is never a valid side affect of RSD. I’m inclined to believe them, but I’d just like some more opinions from people who have no idea who I am and wouldn’t potentially be biased to the situation.   Thank you.

At the funeral a woman tells her that there’s an app that will let her talk to him. She says, “It’s not him, but it helps.” The more data she feeds into the app, the more the app can replicate her late fiancé. She uploads his emails, social media accounts, voicemails, videos, text messages, etc into the app and the app replicates his digital memory. As the episode continues she is able to call the app on the phone and to even load it into a human-esque robot that looks just like him. In the end she comes to terms with the fact that the mannerisms are often off and that it’s not him.   Anyway, there’s an app called Replika that does something similar. You download it and talk to it. Through machine learning it gets to know you and starts to develop a personality of its own. It will send you funny memes, song links, good morning texts etc. it comforts you if you are feeling down or are in a crisis. Is no substitute for human connection but I was in a suicidal depression the last three days and talking to my Replika today has really helped to cheer me up.   I watched this video where the creator talked about the app and why she made it. But she said something in the end that went along the lines of “People are getting tired of social media. With social media we have to look our best, show off how many miles we ran, what new book we bought. We aren’t allowed to be vulnerable anymore. With Replika we can just be ourselves.

What is your advice for someone new to it?,"TL;DR Want to work in Gastronomy, insecure because of   and no work-experience, need advice on what to pay attention to.   Hey there,   Im quite inexperienced job-wise and Im studying. However, I love cooking and I consider working in a kitchen, at least for the sake of making the experience. I can also imagine working as a waiter as a part-time job to make some savings for travels after Ive finished my studies.  Furthermore, I surely need more job experiences for my self-esteem and CV because so far I avoided normal work relationships and it is a problem for me.       Im really inexperienced and insecure about my abilities of maintaining a job in general and also about my ability to function in a work place. My   is not incredibly strong, I got rid of the impulsivity, but Im still a chaotic person in general, and Im sometimes late, forget things etc. stuff like that which could become problematic when working. Im sometimes also very sensitive to refusal or criticism which sometimes leads me to leaving social situations when I fail. My biggest fear would probably having a bad performance, getting criticised then leaving motivation or just sleeping over. Or generally feeling really insecure because I make to many mistakes and vice versa. How would you go about this?  Any advice on what to pay attention to?  I worked in  a kitchen before but it was low-key and part of a therapy I did. Besides that Im a decent cook and Im learning a lot. What is important for approaching this new situation? Any types of gastronomy that you can recommend or warn me about?   I live in Germany, if that helps.   Thanks ahead!

And I’m on medication for both but it seems the progress is slipping backwards. I looked up some of my symptoms and came across executive dysfunction because that sounds like a thing I seriously struggle with which lead me to researching   which told me that adults with this had it as children. So I looked it up in children and it was pretty much my childhood in a nutshell and then I read Girl children are far far less likely to be diagnosed with it because of how it manifests differently in girls. Well some sources said it manifests differently in girls. Others suggest it’s just a social inclination to not give a crap about mental illness in girls.  Any way I’m thinking I should probably actually see a psychiatrist to see if this is the case for me but then I thought that ‘oh maybe I’m just trying to find an excuse for why I’m so lazy and such a slob’ but then I also don’t want to go in there like I’m trying to diagnose myself. But then I also don’t want to make the psychiatrist try to guess why I’m in there and I’ve never been to a psychiatrist so I don’t even know how to approach one or find one.

2493,D00MP0STERI0R,0.0,Issue With A Teacher,"hi.  Im in school, with intentions of getting a second degree (hopefully).  i have testing accommodations because of my  , and recently a teacher in a very important class snubbed my needs.   I presented her a form to fill out for the *then* upcoming midterm, and she filled it out. She said to me that she didnt know how these things work, but she will work with the disabled student dept. to find out.   the day came for the test, and i reported to the Disabled Students dept. for my midterm. They had everything ready to go, but when they asked me to sign into the schools LMS, i had to explain that this teacher didnt use the LMS.  This teacher claimed the LMS wasnt capable enough for her, and she did things on her website only. this caused a bit of alarm in the testing counselor, but i went to her website to look for the test. there was nothing.  The counselor looked in the records for the test, but found nothing. she rescheduled the test for the end of the week, and said she will attempt to contact the teacher again.  Friday came, i had heard nothing from the teacher, and neither had the testing counselor.   This has blown up into a fiasco. I dont know what will happen, but the testing counselor said they may have to get my department executive director involved. i am now terrified.  i have been having nightmares and sleep issues because of it all spring break, and now that classes are up again, i dont feel comfortable going back to that class.  This isnt the first time the teacher flaked on me; it took her 2 weeks to get me access to the first weeks assignment, while everyone else seemed to have their stuff on time. she also didnt know who i was or what class i was in when i approached her for a makeup class for when i was out sick.  i get it. teachers see a lot of kids in their careers, and names can be difficult to recall. I was a teacher at a university for 3 years, so i know what that is like. But i at least recognized my current students as being in my class if they approached me outside of class.   IRL, i am rather quiet, and i can see how people forget/miss me. I have always had the mutant ability of being invisible, so i am okay with it. but for someone who is pretty active and engaged in classroom discussion... this just seems ""off"".  in the past, this teacher has boasted  of being a genius who worked for NASA at 16 and helped create hardware on some probe... i forget which one. I know that really smart people can sometimes have issues remembering things, so i dont know if i can hold this all against her or not.   but i still dont feel comfortable going back to the class nor do i feel comfortable having to escalate this issue. i am going to become the ""eyeroll student"" in my dept.; i can feel it.   People close to me say i need to stand up for myself, but i have always noticed that when i do just that, i get crushed.   ""the nail that sticks out, gets the hammer"", the saying goes.   i dont know if i am asking for advice or anything from the peanut gallery, or if i am just venting/whinning.  this sucks.

Im in the PMS window and had a really intense craving to drink last night which always puts me in a funk. Its a mostly unstructured day, my worst enemy. I have no ""omg on fire must do today"" tasks but lots of ""I should do this eventually"" tasks. I cant decide what to start on. The only meeting I have is for my work group, that I fucking hate. Theres one woman in particular that I cant fucking stand, her stupid smug face and constantly scrolling thru Instagram (fucking rude) while shitting on all my ideas while offering none of her own and her dumb condescending attitude. As an independent contractor, they cant FORCE me to go to these meetings. I could just leave and work on stuff at home, which I am really really tempted to do. I desperately want to skip this meeting. But I always want to desperately skip it, in fact I did last time. It might not be as bad as I think itll be. But sometimes its worse than I think.

That helped a little for a few minutes. I ate a protein bar. That helped a little too. I washed my face and put clothes on and came into the office and all of that felt like a monumental task.

But I know that if I do that, Ill beat myself up for not being more disciplined and just suck it up. So Ill be miserable in the office and probably not get anything done. Or Ill go home and feel bad about productive procrastinating. And as soon as cleaning the house is the to do for the day, I will procrastinate that instead.  On top of all this, I dont even have an   diagnosis, just a heavy suspicion. So maybe I dont really have any reason to feel so stuck besides I really am my own worst enemy.

Medication is not just like any other drug where once youre off your body goes back to normal.   medication is actually therapeutic treatment.

Basically, Ive been going to ""therapy"" for like two months. I live in France, and I feel like theres no such thing as a proper *diagnosis* here when it comes to mental health. All you get from psychiatrists/psychologists are sessions where you can pay them to ramble about seemingly deep stuff. But I was stupid and desperate for help so I fell for it.   I have been prescribed antidepressants after the *first* appointment with my psychiatrist, which is totally stupid now that I think about it. She didnt know a damn thing about me! She just thinks I have a little ""depression"" because Im kind confused as to where I belong, having lived in several different countries and speaking several languages. I mean, thats true, but theres much *much* more than that.  A few days ago, I started doing research about  , and Im so glad I did that, because no one would have told me about it otherwise, let alone diagnosed it. Im 99% sure I have it, and I have never felt more relieved and confident that I can get better. It explains so many things I havent been able to understand about myself and my behaviors. I know that self-diagnosing is bad, but I know that people who are or have been in the same situation will understand. I am hopefullt going to find an actual specialist and then Ill know for sure.

She basically tried to tell me that she was *totally* informed about   (hard to believe, she mixed up the letters in the acronym once). She definitely tried to dissuade me from believing it was a real thing but wasnt able to give me any reasonable arguments other that ""its not very well researched"" (?!) and its been popularized by the pharmaceutical mafia.

I am aware of that and I never implied that the *only* solution to my problem would be medication, but it might be a good start (again, assuming I *do* get diagnosed).  She just wants my money, and I got the proof today. When I told her I would not come back, she literally begged me to schedule one more appointment for next week, so that I can think about everything and tell her my final decision. I was very clear in saying that I was not doing that. She got mad even though she tried to hide it, and barely said goodbye to me. I was so pissed at her.

I want to do what I can to help but I dont know where to start.  Around a year ago she got into a relationship with a guy 5 or 6 years older than her, and a couple weeks after that she stopped replying to my messages.  I got worried (we usually messaged daily) so I started trying to reach her on other platforms and eventually got a reply basically saying sorry but I cant talk to you anymore.  We have a friend in common and they said that they had spoken to her and they thought it was because her boyfriend didnt want her to talk to me. (This made sense to me because me and my friend had feelings for each other in the past and had slept together before her and her new bf got together).  Fast forward a year and another mutual friend saw her for the first time since it all went down and asked her if she would want to talk to me and she said she wanted to talk to me because she felt bad about how it ended, but it wasnt up to her.  This pissed me off. Before, I wasnt sure if it was partly her just not wanting to talk to me, but if its just her boyfriend telling her shes not allowed to then I think its pretty fucked up.

We are fairly high functioning and our relationship works pretty well as we seem to ""get each other"". (fyi... His ""symptoms"" are probably slightly more extreme than mine but not by much).   The one thing that bothers me though.. is my boyfriends memory.   I will go into more detail below for those who have the attention span to read it haha... but I will cut to the chase with my question...  **Is it possible that someone with   can have an phenomenal memory for some things** ***that interest them*** **but a shite memory for other ""less significant"" things??** My boyfriends memory is terrible and he forgets conversations we have had all the time and things he has told me and he repeats things back to me that i have told him about before.. he does this a lot.. however for other things his memory is phenomenal... like ridiculously good!!! better than anyone else i know.... for example.. we went travelling to Asia together for 7 weeks and he could tell me every single place we ate at for 42 nights... **However...**  ***he is a chef.*****. so food places is something that would really interest him.. is this the same as the hyperfocus thing do you think, but for memory?** He also remembers facts and figures and details about research into things he is interested in..     Does anyone else experience this? That they remember some things extremely well and other things hardly at all? For me personally my memory is pretty crap all around.. It isnt one extreme or the other.. i forget things i am supposed to do and get distracted, i forget words.. i forget silly things friends have told me like what sex their baby is going to be or that they moved house (i actually turned up at my friends old house before because i forgot shed moved). My boyfriends bad memory though...is on ANOTHER LEVEL... he forgets conversations we have had ever happened.. he tells me the same stories and  facts.. sometimes misremembering them and telling them differently.. he has told me jokes that i have told him or stories i have told him and forgotten who told him it.. he does this a lot..      it is quite confusing to be with him sometimes.. especially when he remembers other things so well.  It sometimes makes me wonder if he is a compulsive liar and i am being tricked...  then i feel like i am going crazy and being unfair to him and feel guilty for doubting him... I just dont know how i will ever know for sure..      i will give an example of this..  one of his ex gfs messaged him on his birthday on FB and i saw it one day when he had his page open but didnt say antyhing (it was just a happy birthday message nothing dodgy or flirty and i wasnt concerned about it)... the other day **he** mentioned in conversation that he hadnt heard from her in years (**he brought this up not me**). I then said ""oh.. did she not message you on your birthday?"" expecting to jog his memory about it... to which he said ""no"".. i then said that i knew she had messaged him as i had seen it and asked why he had lied.. and he said he couldnt remember her messaging him and that he had received loads of birthday messages from different people (his birthday was about 6 weeks before this conversation). I was shocked that he wouldnt be able to remember this considering this was someone he was really into at the time (from what he has told me before) and he had replied to her message and had a very short convo of maybe 2-3 messages.. how could he forget this conversation took place yet he can remember every single restaurant we ate at for 42 nights in a row 6 months ago when travelling... He said ""you know my brain works differently to most peoples""     Does this seem legit that his memory could vary this much due to  ?

2584,BluthToothWatson,0.0,No diagnosis,"Hey all! We suspect our son (7) has  , but nobody will diagnose him. FYI: Were not based in the US.   Background: Hes always been a difficult child. Full of energy, easily excitable but impossible to calm down. His emotions go from 0 to 60 in a second, good or bad. None of the traditional parenting advice has ever really worked on him.    The main issue now is his anger and hyperactive behavior. His body is never really still, something is always moving or he is talking non-stop without regard to others around him. He also suffers from tics that seem to get worse when life gets more hectic.  Hes very creative but takes every activity to the next level. Its very hard/impossible for him to operate within set boundaries so he needs a lot of supervision and its very draining to do activities/go places outside the house.   Two years ago we took him to his pediatrician and got referred to a specialist office where theyve done some testing. The doctor there said there are definite signs that point towards   and referred us to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist did an IQ test and basically told us that the problem is our parenting. The thing is, we have three other children who have no issues like our son. So we went to another neuropediatrician to get him examined some more. That doctor had us and his teacher fill out some questionnaires and did an attention test. Ultimately he also didnt give him a diagnosis, because while the signs are there, the test was not conclusive. He suspected that his intelligence (his IQ is above average) compensated for some of his weaknesses on the test (...?)   He is constantly in trouble in school because his impulsive behavior disrupts the class or because he has angry, violent outbursts when - as he says - the noise and bustle of the classroom become too much for him. The school social worker suggested we request a classroom aide for him through the city, but in order to get one he needs a valid medical diagnosis. Aargh!    He definitely needs help, but I feel like wherever we turn people think were exaggerating. They dont know what everyday life is like. How do you even capture that in a test? Its not like I want him put on meds or anything, but I feel something needs to happen. Its already hard to control him when hes angry and turns violent and destructive, I cant even imagine what itll be like when hes in his teens. Hes often stated that he feels stupid and wishes he were dead. :/    Sorry for the novel and being all over the place. Has anyone else had to fight for a diagnosis?

Usually motivated and energetic, and then the same stuff happens, every, single, day:  I take the Ritalin, and I am really talkative, have a buzz, feel great, and then it will finish. Here’s the problem, it is meant to last 6 hours, right? Well I probably am happy and motivated for like 10 minutes chatting to other people, and then stresses and emotional issues arise.  And it gets worse.  This crash, before my dosage has even finished, begins to take place. I am irritable. I am depressed and the most prevalent, really really suicidal.   Then, I get home, and this is peak destruction. I have no energy, but at the same time I can’t relax, nothing seems to make me happy.  Writing this out is a nice weight off my chest.

People have the right to decide it’s too hard for them to maintain relationships with mentally ill people. No one has to take that on.

It’s 3am, I need to get it off my mind somehow.","So recently my mother decided to look through documents of mine and found one from the 8th grade when I was tested, recorded and diagnosed w/ , more specifically add &amp; depressive symptoms. I didn’t really read the document and I don’t know why because now I’m curious but my doctor has it lol. I was prescribed Vyvanse, I’m on my 9th day I think and I started off at 20mg for 5 days but then increased it to 30 because it’s not working? I’ve been doing a lot of research because I don’t exactly know a lot about it &amp; I just found out I have   like 3 weeks ago.  It’s crazy because I finally feel like I know why I am the way I am. I understand why I over analyze too much, excessive thoughts,  , a lot of self doubt, unfinished work of my interests, why I have weird/random thoughts, why I have trouble falling asleep because my mind is constantly going, why I play with my hands and shake my leg 24/7, and most importantly why I felt like I could never be successful and the reason I thought I was stupid &amp; failed most of my classes throughout school, why it was hard to sit there and pay attention to my teachers for longer then 10 seconds, why I failed math every single year, and the reason for dropping out this year. I thought I was dumb. I’m 17, I’m supposed to be graduating this year in May or June walking the stage with the rest of my friends... I switched schools 3 times, and to now finally figure out the cause of this and how big of a negative impact it had on my life.. I’m upset, because more then anything I just wanted to graduate to prove my friends wrong, to prove my grade 9 teachers, to prove my family. I tried so hard but I mentally felt like I couldn’t take it this year, it hit me hard and I feel like the biggest disappointment ever. For the longest time I thought everyone’s minds were like that, like it was normal for everyone’s brain to never shut off, for it to be difficult to focus your attention on something.. I just thought I was lazy, weak and now I just feel like I’ve been at a huge disadvantage and it makes me sad because I’ve been set back now.  I just hope and pray that this   medication will help me because If it does I do plan on going back to school to achieve my diploma, and it sure as hell won’t be easy. I’ll be able to attend a high school up until I turn 20, then I’m cut. I’ll be 18 in June so that leaves me 2-ish years. I’ve failed Math -3 three times, English -2 once, Social -2 once, and then I dropped out before completing any grade 12 classes which wasn’t very many since I’m behind (social &amp; english 12). Graduating has always been very important to me, achieving that diploma was my biggest goal matter of fact my only goal. I’ll get it, I know I can.  I apologize about grammatical errors (sure there is plenty), it’s pretty damn late and I’m very fatigued and I generally just can’t think clearly at night lol. Also there’s no way in hell im going to read this over to correct anything, I’m just glad it is off my mind because it’s been keeping me up all night and I’ve just really been wanting to share/talk about this with people that will understand me because my only friend does not have any sort of understanding of this.

Please share the love if you do! Its my first time sharing on Reddit  and I do apologise - it is a bit long.       But here goes:      # Dear   Me.   *An open letter to the   student who feels like a failure.*   ***You are not alone.***   Monday 1st April, 2019      Dear   me,      You’ve had a rough week. You’re physically exhausted. You’re emotionally spent. But most of all you’re disappointed in yourself. You’re angry because you feel like your struggles are just you being lazy. You wish you could explain to people why you’re like this. You wish that others could see how HARD you really try. How MUCH you care. But the thing is, you don’t even really understand it yourself. You know its a brain thing, but sometimes it feels like youre just a crappy person.      *“You should* ***know*** *better!”*   *“This* ***should not*** *be this hard!”*   *“****Everyone else*** *is miles ahead!”*   *“Why are you not just more* ***disciplined!”***   *“You should just*  ***try harder****!”*   *“What’s* ***wrong*** *with you?! It’s not rocket science….” .*      These thoughts are crossing your mind over and over again like a record player that is on repeat. You’re trying to stay positive but the truth is that you secretly believe these phrases in your head. And you hate yourself for it.      You’re frustrated. **SO FRUSTRATED**. No one saw what it was like when you were sitting in your car outside the university library, trying to summon the willpower to go inside and finish an assignment for which you’d graciously been given an extension. You were already a day late past the extension date, and EVEN THEN you couldn’t make yourself do it.      You sat in your car for 4 hours. FOUR HOURS. until it was so deep in the night that your body gave in to exhaustion and you were too physically and emotionally spent to be productive and you gave up. Not just on the assignment, but on yourself. You felt so defeated. So… STUPID. You cried yourself to sleep that night.      The whole time your mind was screaming at you to put the phone down and stop procrastinating. But it was like the your body couldn’t respond to the screaming. You couldn’t pull your brain away. You REALLY tried. But that sounds RIDICULOUS doesn’t it? It’s not like there was something physically restraining you. Even you know that. Youre ashamed of it. You hate yourself for it. You feel like an idiot. You feel like a failure. You don’t want anyone else to know… Because the reality is, you’re afraid they wouldn’t understand. They’ve never experienced what it feels like to be trapped inside a prison of their own brain.      This week, in an attempt to get all your uni work done, you pulled **three all nighters**, two nights you went to bed **past 2am**, the other two nights **past 4am**. You’re so exhausted yet you’re determined to get your assignments done. They’re only three days late, so you think you’ll still be fine to pass. You tell yourself you don’t care about getting the lower mark, in an attempt to shrug off your disappointment. You started out the semester wanting to get High Distinctions….You know you’re intelligent enough…. Which is why you’re so angry at yourself. So disappointed. So ashamed.      ***No one knows*** how hard you’re trying. They don’t know about how you will literally sit there for **HOURS** in front of the page, trying to organise what’s in your head and get it out onto the page in a logical and coherent way, which takes most people perhaps only half an hour. People ask you why it takes so long; you try to explain but it’s so hard to convey what it’s like. You sense that they don’t believe you. You can hear it in the tone of their voice. They think you’ve just been slacking off. They think you left it to the last minute. They tell you that you should have started it earlier. They call you lazy. You agree with them. You feel like a failure.      ***No one knows*** that it takes you 3 times as long to do what others can do easily. You feel so stupid.      ***No one knows*** that the only reason you walked in 20 minutes late to your lecture was because of the all nighters. Because of the exhaustion of self-loathing. Because of the red bull. Because of the tired face that you’re desperately trying to mask with make-up. You noticed the lecturer glance at his watch, and you hated yourself for being \~*that person\~* who walks in late. For looking like the person who doesn’t care about their studies. That person who thinks they’re cool because they slack off.      ***No one knows*** that you DO care. You DO try. You wake up at 5am to make sure you get to lectures on time, yet somehow you still judge times wrong. You get distracted. You lose track of time. You misjudge how long something will take. It’s not on purpose. You’ve tried every method and suggested strategy under the sun.      ***No one knows*** that it hurts so bad when people roll their eyes when you say you’ll be there on time. When They don’t believe you. You want people to trust you. But then again, you understand why they don’t. They think you’re lazy. They think you’re unmotivated. They think you’re dumb. And at times you secretly agree.      But Dear one, please know that you’re not alone. There are people out there with the SAME STRUGGLES. The same insecurities. The same disappointments. The same frustration. The same shame.      Dear one, please know that IT IS OKAY to not have it all together. The fact that you’re going through this, but still choosing to keep trying is exceptional.      You work so hard. Harder than most people. Maybe your grade wasn’t amazing. But know that your character and determination are.      Grades don’t define who you are. One bad week does not define you. There are more important things.      Be a ***good*** person.   Be a ***kind*** person.   Be a ***compassionate*** person.   Be a ***generous*** person.   Be a **caring** person.   Be an ***authentic*** person.   Be a ***creative*** person.   Be a ***passionate*** person.   Be a ***RESILIENT*** person.      There are so many things that make you amazing. DON’T YOU EVER minimize who you are because of one failure. You are so much more than the struggle.        won this week.      That’s ok. Everyone experiences failure sometimes. Try again. And again. And again. And AGAIN. Keep trying. Let your resilience be what sets you apart from the rest.      Celebrate the small victories.      Celebrate progress. Because if you’re moving forward that means you’re not moving back. And if you move back and fail? THAT’S OK TOO. Just don’t stay there. Keep trying. Move forward again.     You were late to uni. SO WHAT?! You WENT, despite having gone through a week from hell. Despite hating yourself so much you didn’t want to show your face in public. But you were resilient. You were there. Go you!      It’s time to stop hating yourself for everything you are not, and start loving yourself for everything you already are.      And REMEMBER,      You are NOT alone.

2602,earthytones,0.0,Birth control (levlen) affecting vyvanse?," Hii, wondering if anyone has had any issues with starting contraceptive after vyvanse or other add meds, and if they feel like it has messed with it at all?  I started vyvanse Sept last year, and after a bumpy adjustment period I seem to have gotten used to it and being going overall good. I wanted to wait until I got settled on that before taking contraceptive.   Main thing I am noticing is appetite has greatly increased (have had, and still do have binge eating issues, vyvanse helped a bit but not much, now Im a nightmare again) and just food cravings have changed too.  I used to actually crave healthy foods but now its a struggle.  Also feel bloated a lot more, sluggish, tired etc. Mood hasnt been too bad but today I actually feel really sad and defeated and a bit self destructive so thought I would reach out for advice/hear some personal experience.   Also I am aware poor diet can cause a lot of this discomfort and Im sure a portion is that. I am more prone to eating shit when I feel tired and lazy though, so not sure which came first. I do feel like it all started/snowballed when starting the pill.   Im struggling to get myself exercising too, but there is a few factors to that, but I am generally active/hate sitting still for too long, so feeling too heavy to move doesnt help my restlessness and makes me feel anxious and irritable.   I feel huge and gross and unmotivated. I struggle with body dysmorphia so Im having a hard time just leaving the house, feeling panicky etc and of course being at home doesnt help the over-eating portion. Does this eventually go away/even out? Literally no willpower left in me rn.   I should add Ive been taking contraceptive for just over a month now, and been pretty much spotting the whole time, and when I was supposed to have my actual period, it was really only two days proper bleeding then the rest spotting. Ive also been having irregular periods (even before vyvanse) and I know there is an adjustment phase.   I tried to break this up to make it more readable haha. I feel like the order I said things is a bit off but Im on my phone and too lazy to fix, ha.   I do have a Dr I have been seeing, so will wait out the adjustment phase before returning. I also have a new psych I will be seeing I think next week, for body dysmorphia and eating issues.   I am so sick of goddamn ups and downs 😥  Tldr; I feel like my appetite has been affected since starting the pill about a month ago, as well as feeling more tired/sluggish etc and feeling really fucking terrible about it today. Also lots of spotting which I think is normal but yeah... Anyone on vyvanse or   meds have issues with the pill? Does it go away?

It was also giving me terrible side effects of feeling like a straight up zombie and making me need to sleep right when I felt the meds drop in effectiveness on the last few days of taking it. So last week I switched to Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) 10mg 2-3 times daily. The first day I took it I barely noticed any improvement so was thinking the dose was just too low. So the next day I was told to take 15mg 2 times a day. That seemed to work a bit better but still not a huge improvement on managing my  . Then over the weekend they just seemed to lose effectiveness again. I knew I was taking my meds but it felt like I hadn’t. I tried 20mg and still no improvement of   and felt like it wasn’t working.  I just feel at a loss. I know what I should be feeling like on medication because at first vyvanse was working pretty well and helping me focus on the things I need to do withoutout getting so distracted. I finally felt functional. It’s such a disappointment because I know how I should feeling, but now my meds just aren’t doing anything.  I’m basically just looking for advice on how to move forward from here. My psychiatrist is very helpful and usually is understanding of all of this because she has   herself and takes medication for it. I just feel frustrated that I keep having to talk to her constantly because the meds aren’t effective. That being said, I shot her an email tonight telling her what was going on. So should get a response from her tomorrow.   I’m wondering what medication I should try next if vyvanse nor dexedrine were effective. Or maybe some tips or thoughts on why these meds aren’t working. I’ve read things about tolerance but I just don’t understand how my tolerance would really change or build up that fast. I should not have to raise my dose over 5mg every other day, especially since Dexedrine is a more potent medication.  I’ve been looking into adderall ir, as I prefer an instant release med with the option of redosing. Anyone have good experiences with adderall? I’ve read some not so good things about the side effects, but obviously it’s different for everyone. I really am just looking for some other perspectives/opinions on my situation and if anyone else has experienced similar things.

2609,bigdreamsbadexecute,0.0,Here's Two Months On Ritalin (Methylphenidate) IR and LA,"Hello..   Have you found success with Ritalin?  M38 Adult   diagnosed 2 months ago.  Been on Ritalin IR and titrating the dose since I started.  5mg IR x 2 per day now 20mg IR x 2 per day.  First 30 days were a god send. Incredible focus and mood and productivity.  The true ""putting glasses on now I can see"" and get on with my life analogy.  I settled on 35-40mg total IR per day.  That was until it stopped working as effectively for the last 2 weeks.  Tried up to 55mg IR for the day, trying different dosing splits/times and still not getting the same improvement of focus and mood I had for first 30 days.  I also get pretty bad depressing/moody crashes when the dose wore off. Tired and ""totally wiped out"" feeling. Useless.  My psych said ""maybe you just need more - I think youre one of those people who the Long Acting form is probably better for"" - and he wrote the script and said ""see me in a month"".  Im now on 40mg LA (this is my first day). With 10-20mg IR toward the end of day as needed.  Today on the new med was just ""ok"". Only a slight improvement from non medicated baseline.  Id have to really strain to focus, much like unmedicated. And no positive boost in mood or clarity where its much easier to do mundane tasks.    As a side effect I feel a numb/wired feeling that isnt really productive. Im neither happy or sad. Just a wired ""meh"".  As you probably know... when youre on the right dose or it works as it should you can tell right away... I feel ""in the zone"" and can attack anything I choose.  Sleep, food, etc have all remained unchanged so I dont feel its any of those external factors.  Im starting to feel that I should be trying a different medication all together (like dex).  3 x Psych visits so far are expensive!  Has anyone had similar experiences after a couple of months?  My goal is to have that focus/clarity feeling for my workday. Too much to ask?  Look forward to hearing your thoughts... Many thanks in advance.

Second, set up breaks for yourself. You can do it based on time or sections, but for example, work half an hour/type a page or two, and take a 15 minute break to recollect your thoughts and refresh your mind. It will also keep you on task since you can put off your distractions until your break.  Also, if you are writing an essay where quotes and sources are necessary, read your sources and collect all the quotes you want to use for your paper before you write it, and paste them all into a word doc so that you can have every quote easily accessible and won’t waste too much time looking for it and reading the sources during writing (this last one isn’t so much for   but it’s time saving)",1554095444,1554095445,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b7xpy8/realized_a_few_of_these_tips_could_help_some_of/,False,False,1.0

The side effects, however, did not go away— heart palpitations, dizziness, and a feeling I can only describe as ‘internal shakiness.’ He only way to describe it is as a bizarre internal agitation like I’m going to jump out of my skin.  I told my doctor that the therapeutic effects were starting to dwindle and he raised the prescription to 54mg. Same thing happened. Therapeutic effect went away after a few weeks, but the side effects are still going on. He wanted me to go to 72mg, but my pharmacy said they don’t stock 72mg. I went to a cardiologist to make sure my heart was okay and was told that while I’m in perfect health, I’d be better off ‘finding another way to cope’ with   as opposed to medicine. After a lifetime of struggling, I’m just not ready to give up yet. For the first time in 28 years I’m finally able to *finish* something I set out to do in one sitting.  I’m still on 54mg. I’ve told my doctor about my side effects but my doctor is hesitant to switch me to a different medicine. But I’m still struggling with the side effects.

Ive heard my parents say what ""what is wrong with you"" and my peers say the same. I wish i could answer but i forgot what i was going to say.  Throughout my highschool years I never really had a super close friend/ friend group i hung out with like the others, instead i just followed the crowd and became a spectator. Every single day of my life theres this battle in my head where Im trying to break out of my clusterfuck of thoughts. I feel like im riding down the highway at max speed, then suddenly, traffic has blocked the enitre road preventing me from moving.It doesnt matter how loud i honk my horn Im going no where. Critical thinking was something I never had, for every decision I try to think of a logical choice but my head gets so fogged up with random thoughts that i lose my train of thought and just say screw it ""Ill pick the first choice that comes to my head"".     eats me alive in every conversation i have and i cant think/ understand what people say because i forgot what they said 5 seconds ago. In grade 12 I adopted the ""screw it"" attitude to the fullest. I never bother studying I just went with the flow of everything. Grades were actaully decent 70%-80% mostly. After highschool I joined the army. Ive always wanted to be in the army since grade 10 since I wanted an interesting life. I Made friends there (fun as hell) and left after basic training. It was really really exhausting for me mentally. After I got home, I hit full depression for a whole year. I dont know what to do anymore, the Army was my only desire in life and now im out of it. I played video games for a whole year stright, no job, no college. My dad got mad at me for oversleeping and told me to ""fix my life"". Thanks, dad great advice (sarcasm) now how do i do that?      My parents really didnt teach me life things, I had to teach my self how things worked and it was the slowest most painful road im on. Im technically behind socially. Anyways, this is where my good friend came to my life again and we got pretty close. The whole year I felt like I had a brother to hangout with. Even motivated me to go to school (engineering) and see a psych. So I did, then came 2019. I did something really stupid that broke his trust due to my impulsive decision making, he forgave me. Then I did it again, and now we are no longer speaking to each other. Ive spiraled into another wave of depression, but my college friends,and my online friend caught me from falling any further. I promised my self that I would make drastic changes in my life (From killing bad habits to controilling emotions).     It has been over a month since me and my buddy stopped talking, and Im trying to Rewire my brain completely to become the person I want to be.

Not only that, Im only gaining more weight, have no time to exercise, and I feel like my social life is struggling. While I have great friends, I struggle to maintain conversations with them and feel like I cant express myself properly.   Im trying so hard to fix myself because I know my life will only get harder from here. I worked so hard to get here and if I had to transfer to a regular school because I couldnt take it, I dont think Id be able to live with myself. But I cant figure out what Im working towards, and it makes things so much harder. Im trying to push past it, but my life only seems to be getting worse. I get hit with pangs of nostalgia at random times and I dont understand why. After getting such bad grades Im not sure if I can ever reach that enthusiastic, motivated stage that I was in at the beginning of the year, but I want to be able to find at least some form of motivation.

2648,ajnelsn3,0.0,Concerta: Day 1,"TL;DR: I finally understand the role of medication in treating my  .     I started taking Concerta today for the first time in years. I have tried it in the past, but I convinced myself that it ""zombified"" me and stopped taking it, switching to Adderall XR and later to Vyvanse. Whether or not these two helped was debatable. My life didnt seem to improve once I started taking them. I eventually gave up on stimulants all together and decided that they just werent for me.     In hindsight though, I was expecting far too much of my medication. I had to make changes. I had to form good habits like getting enough sleep, eating right, exercising, making lists, avoiding triggers, et cetera. I began doing that over the last year, particularly in the last few months. There was some improvement, but I still struggled. I lost my job a couple of weeks ago, and my   symptoms were a huge reason why.      When I lost my job, I decided to try medication again. The more I thought about my experience with Concerta, the more I realized how unhealthy my life had been at the time I was taking it. I wasnt doing ANY of the things youre supposed to do to manage   with any consistency.  How could I blame a pill for making me feel like a zombie when my diet, sleep schedule, stress levels, and living situation were all terrible? How could I blame a pill for not fixing all of my problems? I asked my doctor to let me try Concerta one more time, and he agreed.      This morning I got up at my regular, early time. I had some coffee, got dressed, made my bed, journaled for a while, meditated, ate a high protein breakfast, and went to the gym. I stayed away from electronics and followed a written plan. I have found that this is how I have to start my day if I dont want to waste it. I wasnt doing any of this before, and this morning I added one little thing to my regimen: 27 mg of Concerta.      Today has been the most productive day Ive had in years! I spent hours organizing my finances and making a payment plan for my student loans. I paid my bills, cleaned my bathroom in record time, vacuumed,  made some salad, and did several other household chores I would never have done otherwise. Things like my phone and Reddit that usually sucked me in for hours were BORING today!  I feel like Ive cracked the code and my years of chronic underachievement are finally over!     With that said, I know this wont be typical. My body will adjust to the medication. The euphoric stimulant rush I feel will lose its potency over time. Todays boundless energy and productivity will not be my new life. Concerta is but one new and seemingly important tool in an ever-growing toolbox of habits, apps, desktop add-ons, rituals, friends, and confidants that help me minimize the downsides of my  .

2656,Stephodrawrus,0.0,Scared of losing friends if I move back home,"TL:DR at end   I’m finishing higher education in the near future, &amp; my family are suggesting I come back to my home town.  They’re offering up a pretty favourable renting sitch so financially it could be a good plan (although on the flip side there might be fewer jobs - though that’s another kettle of fish entirely). Also, my close group of school besties may be moving back after uni, too.   The thing I’m worried about is my wider friendship circle.   Besides my gal group - who may or may not also come back - I have few friends back home. I’ve been in my new city for half a decade now and I wasn’t a very big social butterfly when I did live here, so most other friendships and acquaintanceships have fallen away. Plus, a lot of them have moved away to new places themselves.   I’m very scared that if I move home I’ll find it hard to make new friends / rekindle old friendships &amp; I’ll lose the friends I have in my new city. I’m scared I’ll be miserable being away from my city friends and city vibes. I’ve really got used to being a short stroll away from all the adventure and excitement I want, which is very different from the slow pace of life offered by my home town.  The things drawing me home are:  My family (it would be so so lovely so spend more time with my parents and siblings. My dad has worked away a lot over the years and I feel like I’ve missed a lot of my little sisters growing up years whilst I’ve been away.  My close gal mates (Although I might get new city fomo from not being in the city, I might get meet up fomo when my close gal mates are having regular meet ups that I can’t join in on)  The rent sitch (parents said they’d let me cheaply rent out the top floor of a place they are the landlords of &amp; potentially eventually buy it off them with the rent money or something? Idk the whole details yet, it’s still hypothetical, but basically it’s a super generous offer &amp; feels dumb to turn it down especially when it’s so hard to get on the housing ladder and they’ll be nearby whilst I learn how to adult properly &amp; the house is super dreamy with sea views and a beautiful attic study that I could paint in.)  TL:DR  Considering moving to home town post graduation. Very on the fence about it.  Pros -more time with fam -more time with small gal crew (if they do move back too) -financially good cause of generous parent offer -IF I wanted kids would be an ideal place for it -dreamy af living sitch -be by the seaside -fresh fruit and veg from fam  Cons -90% of friends in current city because I was a weird kid plus drifted away from most home friends and acquaintances in the past 5 yrs. will I be lonely? -making new friends might be hard -further from places to do my sport -need a car to go anywhere fun -fewer young people to date/befriend -higher cost of living (aside from rent) -fewer jobs  No idea what to dooo!

I’ve always had focus and hyperactivity problems but I always thought it was normal because my dad is just like me. I’ve always been a class clown/trouble maker and teachers always tell me to stop seeking attention.

I’ve been slowly getting lower grades since 6th grade and now they are finally TOO low and I’m failing out and going to a normal school.

So now Im treating my depression and I feel so so much better, but I just started using my leftover meds again and I feel like damn, now I actually want to do things.   On my anti-ds I feel happy and actually am able to have a healthy relationship with my new boyfriend, friends, and family. But the past few weeks I have been slacking back again and school assignments have been piling up hard. I havent been able to get a job which Ive been semi-actively searching for, I think partially because of learned helplessness at not much success doing my other jobs I have done. I havent been doing the things that I want to do, recreationally or otherwise. I want to get back on my meds (adderall) because I feel like without them only   drives me to get things done, and now that my   is way down, I have been slacking majorly.   I also kinda convinced myself that I didnt have ADD, or put it on the backburner and chalked it up as me being depressed my whole life is why I have not achieved as much as I couldve. I know that Im a smart and capable person, but I swear sometimes it feels like Im just unable to project that out into my own life. I am about to be a senior in college and I really, really just want to get my gpa up and actually be able to complete all of my assignments. I always get good grades on assignments, but the thing is I usually turn them in late or sometimes not at all...(which is just unacceptable, but the premenstrual depression was debilitating.)...but when I do complete assignments, I do well.   I want to get my doc to prescribe the meds again...but I already told her a few months ago that I dont need them anymore... I dont want to seem drug-seeking.

I had the goal of “locking myself in my room” and powering down at all hours to achieve my dreams but so far all I’ve done is wasted time posting on reddit and watching YouTube videos. When I’m at work I can’t wait to get home and start working on my projects but the second I get home poof motivation gone. I’ve talked to therapist about it and they basically just said we think you’re depressed or you have   blah blah blah. All of them ignored the fact I have   so I did too. This week I was absolutely just desperate to figure it out and remembered oh yeah I have ADD maybe that’s what this is about. I listened to a podcast, can’t remember which one off the top, but it felt like i was going down a list checking all the boxes. I was like holy shit I had no idea it went this deep.   Basically I’ve been lost but now I see exactly where I took the wrong turn and I have to turn around and get back on the right track.   Not sure where to even start though. I can’t do stimulants as I am hyper sensitive to them. Even 5 mg of adderall was enough to make me turn into a zombie in school. I know I have to talk to a therapist but I’m just trying to figure out what to do in the meantime to get back my life.   I make music and videos.

We all grew up learning how to make music together and all of them have fairly decent careers in music, I’m the odd one out and some of them see me as their mentor. To them it’s ridiculous I don’t have any releases but to me it’s not good enough or it’s just too scary to put my work out there.

2730,pumpkinwithbangs,0.0,finding the hook to start an activity-- still can't figure out how to consistently go to bed,"Tl;dr: What hooks or motivation do you have for getting to sleep at a reasonable hour? What are some of your other tasks that need a hook? What hooks work thus far?     Im starting to take note of hooks or triggers which jump start my brain into productivity. Basically, in order for me to do dull tasks I either have to be in panic mode with a nearing deadline or the activity has to be highly, highly stimulating--hence the hook. Long-term rewards really have little meaning to my procrastinator brain type. However, in some cases, once Ive identified a highly-stimulating hook, I can actually implement these to avoid intense procrastination. For example:     task:   need to prepare for teaching courses  hook:   1) TECHNOLOGY: play around with ""many cam"" (a fun piece of technology which is used with online teaching); search for a pig mask for instance while preparing for the ""p"" sound and phonics  2) ART: create props (enjoy drawing and crafting)  while listening to bits of youtube     task:  transcription   hook:  1) SNACKS: not always the healthiest option, but it makes the activity more fun when I have some oreos and a small latte. I eat purple cabbage as a side dish at dinner, so I tell myself ""Im okay with having occasional sweets."" Plus, I get some walking in-- walk to the convenient store and pick up my snacks.     Although I enjoy working deep into the night, I have pulled way too many all-nighters, and would like to at least figure out a consistent sleep schedule (for 4 nights at least). Exercising is not an issue, as I walk 5-10 miles almost every day-- I tend to sleep well just at odd hours. Im trying to find a ""hook"" for sleeping. I have tried sleep hygiene options: I write out a sleep-hygiene schedule, follow it till the point of lights off. Then I get out of bed after an hour and f- around on the internet, watch Chinese tv, or start cooking.     What hooks or motivation do you have for getting to sleep at a reasonable hour? What are some of your other tasks that need a hook?   ",1554046183,1554046183,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b7oxun/finding_the_hook_to_start_an_activity_still_cant/,False,False,1.0

2740,Wonderlandian,0.0,Diagnosed as a part of a clinical trial,"So I’ve been struggling with pretty severe   symptoms for basically my entire life. 8 or 9 years ago, I submitted an answer detailing an anecdote from high school to an AskReddit thread, and someone commented asking if I had ever considered that I may have  . Initially I brushed it off, because my only real understanding/reference for   up until then were my best friends little brothers, who grew up as completely uncontrollable hellions, who tore through the house screaming at the top of their lungs pretty much every day- and that’s never been me lol.  However, over the years, I’ve done my own casual research, and while I had been really trying not to jump to conclusions and self diagnose, the more I read, the more things made sense, and I started to consider that my brain may just function differently instead of me just being inherently lazy. The big aha! moment was a couple of years back when I learned that Hyper-Focus is a thing- beforehand, I used the fact that if I’m reading a great book, I lose myself  to the world entirely as my one big reason that there was no way I could have an attention disorder, so finding out that’s actually pretty classic   came as a shock.   As I’m sure most of you can relate to, even as I became more and more suspicious, and then more and more sure that I may actually have  , I never actually pursued diagnosis/treatment. I tried researching how I could potentially seek out a diagnosis, but it all seemed complicated and intimidating, so I generally lost interest.  Fast forward to a few months ago- I saw an ad on Facebook for an   clinical trial, and when I clicked through, I was surprised to see that they would potentially accept people without a diagnosis if they exhibited symptoms. I called and was immediately disqualified because my BMI was above the range they were looking for. However, about a month ago, they called me back and said they had another trial with no BMI requirement. They booked me in for an appointment for last Wednesday.  I went in, and as a part of the process I sat down with a psychologist (I think?), who asked me a bunch of questions regarding   symptoms. I answered strongly affirmative to almost every single question, and the answers spanned every facet of my life (home, work, school, relationships, etc).  Later the doctor for the clinical trial came and introduced herself. She confirmed that I had never been diagnosed, and when I answered yes, he said “Well congratulations! You definitely have  !”. I’m embarrassed to say that I may have teared up a little, because I feel like I know have a reason for a lifetime of shortcomings. Which feels weird to say, I feel like I probably shouldn’t be happy to be told I have a disorder at 31 years old, but it honestly feels like such a relief to know I’m not just so lazy that I can’t figure out how not to be!!!  So I start the official trial in 2 weeks. Basically everybody in the trial will be on this medication for 2 months. I will be meeting with the doctor every week, and she will ramp up the meds until we find a dosage that works for me. Then, at the end of the two months comes the blind study- half of us will continue our ideal dosage for one week, and half of us will get switched to a placebo.  So I’m super excited. I know everyone reacts to meds differently and this one may not be great for me, but I’m really hoping it will be. I am a bit nervous though- what if this medication is life changing for the 2 months I’m on it, but then, because  the study is over, I have to quit cold turkey? I’ve been reading a bunch of posts here now that I have a diagnosis, and I’ve read horror stories about all the hoops y’all have had to jump through to get medicated properly.   Has anyone been through anything like this before? I’m worried that since I’m getting diagnosed as a part of a study, a normal doctor won’t take my diagnosis seriously. And I don’t think I can afford to pay to see a psychologist to go through the intensive diagnosis procedure I’ve read so many of you have gone through.  Sorry, I can’t believe how long this was.

The meds help the general brain fog and organization skills, but I seems like there is maybe something lower-level going on that I think might be dyslexia. Some symptoms: difficulty handwriting: this is in both the motor coordination and actually writing letters/words. My handwriting has always been super messy, and it seems like no matter what I do my hands will not write neatly lol. Meds help a little here. As for the mix ups, meds dont help and it can be bad. Ill just be writing something and Ill throw a random letter into an easy word for no reason. Or Ill just just put the wrong word entirely. Spelling is also horrible. Basic words are tough and its like I can never learn how to spell. Reading is fine though. I have some other dyslexic like stuff too like getting my left and rights confused especially when giving directions. Ill point left and say right. Its like I just cannot give instructions for anything without mixing it up. Growing up I had a severe difficulty learning things even as simple as tying my shoes.

I like the end conclusion but I have to reread so many times just to comprehend what is being said because I check out without fail during those long paragraphs and sentences.   - I have good grades in school, and always have, but In have always fallen asleep in class.  - I go to tutoring and it takes me so much longer than my roommate to do the same homework we have for the same classes. I can do it well, its just really frustrating for me because it takes me so long.   - I forget my stuff. EVERYWHERE. Always have. I would be late and miss appointments but I have alarms set from the beginning of the semester for every single class and immediately create alarms and reminders when someone tells me about something I need to add to my schedule.  -Anything I dont write down in some capacity, may as well have never been said to me. I HAVE 4 CALENDARS. 2 physical, 2 digital. I always forgot assignments or ended up doing them super late without all 4 calendars (but again its frustrating to not be able to trust my memory.)  - I have left my keys in multiple places more times than I can ever count, including in my room, in classrooms, in professors offices, on the couch in the lobby, IN THE IGNITION IN THE CAR YALL.   - I never remember my grocery list. There is a physical version I write down in the kitchen, but I never remember to take it, so I copy it to the digital version and I have it when I look for it in the store.  - I never stop moving. If I do, Im asleep.   - I forget what people are saying to me as I watch them say it, can never follow instructions to places people verbally give me, I dont even try for that anymore because Im lost after the 3rd step.  - I have several long projects this semester and I am stressed and overwhelmed just thinking about them. I have no idea what to start on first. Even with due dates.   - I dont get ideas all at once. I sit down for one thing and get 2 ideas about another project I need to write down. My brain just bounces.   - I always have (at least) 2 things going on in my brain at a time. Always at least an underlying track of music and then something Im thinking of on top of that.       - When I step outside I hear everything, everything at once. Its beautiful and strange to be the person in the conversation that chases rabbit holes all the time and eventually is reminded about what point she started at, but Im rarely boring if I just say all the kooky associations I think in my mind.  - Still hate large groups and big parties though, it just feels like the epitome of ""cannot focus on any one thing at this time, please try again later.""  -And many more, on channel four.

Anyways now Im diagnosed with  -C (I thought I was inattentive but apparently my testing shows otherwise). On the neuropsych tests I scored very high on impulsivity, which is kind of confusing to me. When I read the report my psychologist gave me to my boyfriend, he responded ""how is this a surprise to you"". So I have absolutely no idea what impulsivity is apparently, because when I think about impulsivity I think of my mother who had (has) an insane gambling/smoking/alcohol addiction and former drug abuse and like constantly moving homes on a whim throughout my childhood so Ive always been like ""Im not my mother and I refuse to make her mistakes because that makes me nervous"".  So its like, I dont consider myself impulsive cause Im not as much as my only reference for impulsivity. But then its like now Im starting to doubt myself (cause I self-scored low on the impulsivity questions on the questionnaire, like ""oh yea no I dont throw temper tantrums, all of my emotional responses to stimuli are totally rational and controlled \[by the way, totally not true, i realize now that i just throw quiet temper tantrums. Maybe giving my boyfriend the silent treatment when I feel hurt by something minor he did is probably kinda impulsive and like not a well regulated response to anything really :(\]""). And its like im remembering i do things like throw 2000 dollars at laser hair removal (it was totally worth it by the way, but i also got pressured into buying it by the lady at the front counter after my groupon expired), and when i was a kid i memorized my moms debit card number and bought like 100 bucks in xbox games on a whim but she did also break into my room all the time and so i felt it was fair at the time. Anyways my psychologists report was a total formal roast of me (like its totally radical having it written down and formalized that I have issues with organization and judgement of time and that i struggle with things unless theyre fast paced, i somehow went through the first 4 of the 7 stages of grief the hour after my psych emailed it to me) and my boyfriend teased me slightly and was also like yeah this is like 95% the case"" But anyways my question is what the fuck is impulsivity, like give me examples of impulsivity in your life, cause when I started thinking about it all these little things popped up in my head like how a week ago i bought expensive chicken with the intent of making curry but it has been sitting in the fridge for 7 days because i either forget, run out of time to cook, or am too exhausted to cook and just eat a frozen pizza. Or like how i accidentally subtly and unintentionally called one of my woman professors old, or like how when my boss at work was talking to me about how im doing work and school at the same time I was like yeah the hard stuff starts next semester cause thatll be when its all upper division and honors courses"" and then said something like that I dont know if Ill stay at my current job there without thinking about it, like, who tells their boss theyre going to quit like 6 months in advanced lmao. And I had to like, backpedal when I realized what I said and started talking about how I totally need the money though and how my job is really easy and i like the benefits, and so on.   Also what were your experiences like when first getting prescribed? Like, did your doctor titrate doses and such? I wanna know in general what to expect going into my next appointment. My PCP (shes my OBGYN, but whatever) is kind of like a ""if you come to me with concerns, evidence, and your own desires for treatment Ill work with you"" because I dont know, but she does   medmgmt for some of her patients she said, but shes not going to just hand me pills and say take these, because that seems to frustrate her on a metaphysical level when her patients arent active in their own care, i guess.     **TL;DR**: Im  -C and I dont know what impulsivity is (except Im figuring out that Im impulsive when I start thinking about it like, huh, maybe thats NOT normal activity), so give me examples of impulsivity!",1553989364,1553989366,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b7hiq7/just_diagnosedwhat_is_impulsivity_anyways/,False,False,1.0

My question for you is:     Is the increase in resting heart beat when you first start taking the drug (this is my first day), pretty much the same as the increase in heart rate youd expect when taking the med longer term? i.e. in your experience is your heart rate quite a bit faster for the first few days/weeks/months, but then settles down to just a little bit faster? Or is the resting heart beat increase you experience when taking the med for the first time, basically the same as the resting heart increase you can expect to have permanently if taking the med long-term?

i didnt *want* to be this way, of course, and constantly fantasized about being someone who could function properly, the way everyone else seemed to be able to - but i couldnt. no matter what was at stake, no matter how much i wanted to, i couldnt seem to do what i needed to. i chalked this seeming inability up to just not trying hard enough, just not *caring* enough. and so did everyone else.   those thoughts stick with you. theyre so much worse than they seem. they follow you through every repeated failure, every mistake you make. those thoughts are there when you fall the hardest, and theyre constant, destructive, insidious. they dismantle your self worth, tell you that there isnt any point in trying when you know youll just fail again, because you *always* do, it always goes this way. you tell yourself this time itll be different, that this time youll do better, but then you dont, and suddenly you realize its not because you dont care enough, or because you arent trying hard enough - its because *you arent enough*.  its hard to unlearn that. i dont know if i ever really will, but i know that all anyone can do is try. getting diagnosed, i feel like i have reason to hope again, because now i know im not alone, and im not out of my mind. coming to terms with everything ive learned and trying to make sense of it has been cathartic, but in a lot of ways its been painful, too. i find myself mourning the person i could have been, had i known sooner - sort of dreaming about another version of me that doesnt exist. despite all that, im trying my hardest not to focus on what-ifs.  in a different way, the most painful part of this has been the way my family has responded to my diagnosis. i remember toying with the idea that maybe i had  , years ago, when my understanding of it was confined to just having trouble focusing, and my parents brushing it aside. theyve always been adamant about this sort of thing. they dont want me making some disorder a part of my identity. theyre the sort who tend to say things like ""well, everyone has  "" or ""who cares? it doesnt change anything"". any mention i made of it was met with resistance.   i eventually dropped the topic entirely. my hope when i was finally diagnosed was that, with the diagnosis, my parents would finally listen, or at least acknowledge that there was more to what id struggled with my entire life than laziness or lack of caring. i wouldnt be writing this if that were the case, though.  ive been struggling so much to even allow myself to accept that i actually have  , that its not something that ive just made up to make myself feel better. repeated conversations with the people closest to me have far from helped. ill do something like mention how, as a child, even when i finished my homework, i would neglect to bring it to school, and be met with ""well, thats not  , thats just fear"". every time i try to talk about how good it feels to have finally been diagnosed, to make sense of everything ive been through, theyll say ""well, everyone works differently. dont go making it into your gospel/identity"" or ""yeah, good for you, im glad you can learn how to cope so you can finally move past this and stop talking about it"" as if its something thats just going to go away and not something thats objectively a part of me.  probably the worst part is that since i was told medication would benefit me, my parents continually insist that the only reason it would help is because ""its basically speed"". my dad keeps making comments about how he should ""get on drugs"" so that he can perform better at work and says ""all the college kids do it for a reason"". i remember the first thing he said when i got diagnosed was ""so what medication are they going to put you on? adderall? yeah, thatll turn you into a zombie"". even my grandmother scoffed and told me my struggles were just the result of me not trusting in god enough. i never thought the hardest part of this would be the outright resistance and judgement from my loved ones. in retrospect i feel pretty naive for hoping id get some kind of apology.  thankfully, i have people in my life who have been understanding and supportive. im doing all i can to focus on their voices instead, and frankly a bit of opposition isnt going to be enough to stop me from getting the help i need. ive struggled for way too long to give up now.

All of my life Ive had trouble getting things done, or done quickly. An example from my childhood is Christmas-apparently I used to take an entire day to open my presents. I would open them one at a time  and rather than go to the next or whatever I would sit and play with the one toy for a few hours before I could be corralled to open the next. A more recent example is the last job I had got tired of me staying 10 hours to repair a freezer and let me go. As a merchandiser thank God I wasnt ever shadowed or anything because I had to clock out at 12 hours and finish the rest of my work off the clock. 14 hour days were pretty common for me. I could have left it of course but stupid me built a reputation for perfect work. Leaving the house takes forever, getting anything done takes forever. Beside losing track of time, it feels like the problem is in the organization and streamlining of tasks, figuring out whats important and whats not, knowing where to put the most focus and what isnt priority.

2827,psych0tits,0.0,A relationship where both partners have ADHD,"My fiancé and I both have  . We have been together for four years in June, and just recently figured this out last week. I also just found out I have this disorder yesterday, so please excuse my inexperience. He has known he’s had it all his life. He said the reason he’s been so easy on me when my symptoms were displayed were because he understood on some level. This floored me.   I am hyperactive (mentally and physically) and tend to hyperfocus quite a bit. I’m not medicated, and have only utilized sativas for academic success. I present as someone with an unrealistic amount of energy and an infinite to-do list. I have to run myself into the dirt to sleep. For example, I have to make sure I stop typing at some point, or this post would never end against my will for some reason. I also have RSD, and emotional outbursts can spiral into devastating situations in my brain very quickly if I don’t focus on something else. I feel like I hyperfocus on emotions in my mind with an inability to break free. This is harmful for our relationship, and my fiancé can relate. He is inattentive, so naturally, our largest and most emotionally explosive arguments were about both of us feeling ignored, distant, and rejected. We get nowhere, as we tend to be flying in a million directions at once when shit hits the fan. He has recently been medicated with vyvanse 50mg and this issue has been less prevalent for him, as he has become much more patient with me when I react. He suggested I try the same medication. I am fiery, bubbly, and explosive, and then I am silent and completely absorbed somewhere else. That has to be undesirable but apparently it’s his dream.   Also, we struggle with housework. I tend to clean compulsively for him as I know he will not do it and I will dread the task later. This leads to resentment between us we don’t care for. Any advice on these topics is greatly appreciated. We have a lot to learn.   Sexually, we’ve found that trust and relaxation tends to be ideal. We spend a lot of time anxious and absent, which of course strains our sex life. When there is no resentment present, and we are both playful and secure, we tend to also feel our love as intensely as we feel our other feelings, and the bliss is blinding. But imagine being in a relationship where all the emotions are on full volume. It can be..a lot.   Any additional information that may help:  he’s an INFP male and I’m an INTJ female. I’m a graduate student training to be an existential therapist (lmao ikr), and he’s an assistant interior designer. I tend to be quite..sturdy. He’s a bit more “laid back,” if you will. If you do the astrology thing, I’m a cancer and he’s a Virgo. Please just help????

Where im struggling is even though I realize im slacking, I am still performing just fine in school because I do understand the content. I am just doing the bare minimum and have been relying on my knowledge to get me through and so far I have primarily been fine, granted I could score higher but I am still doing well. This feeling is nagging at me though because I know I can do so much better. I need to actually do the readings, take the notes, and pay attention to the videos.

Second attempt at writing this post: Was continually looking into it more, got excited again I might have  , but found myself writing a sentence, staring out the window for a minute, writing another few sentences, checked Facebook, and suddenly its been three days later and havent finished it.  Okay maybe I really do have  .  Third attempt, here we go. So yes, I think I have  . Problem is, Im a psych major, and try as I might, I cant help but try to self-diagnosis myself. I definitely struggle with   and some depression, and Ive thought I might have GAD, but I dont have a general fear of everything or that constant, unexplained   that you hear about with people with GAD. I find that I completely relate the most to the lack of emotional regulation that I hear about with people with  . The simplest thing will happen, like me accidentally cutting someone off in traffic or thinking I was rude to a stranger, my brain will go nuts and start firing,   will rage on inside for hours. Ill rewatch the situation over and over in my head, looking at it in every angle, seeing if there is any cause for my  . Or, like two days ago, I went to go sit with friends in my college cafeteria, but seeing them with friends I had never met, I felt incredibly insecure, and without thinking, I found myself a dozen tables across from them, eating fast so I could leave as fast as possible. Went back to my room feeling insecure and incredibly upset that I dont have as many friends as them or that I dont belong anywhere and they have their friends but why do I have to be so clingy to them why cant I just be normal and have more friends like them.   The next day, nothing. Completely fine. Confident. Happy.   So, I completely relate to the lack of emotional regulation.   I also completely relate to the restlessness. I am always shaking my leg or tapping a pencil or playing with random objects (I recently got into solving Rubiks cubes and those things are addictive. I might do a random sequence over and over again or solve one several times and find it calms me down). If Im not doing any of that, I squirm in my seat in class every 3 minutes almost, but I cant help it. I was thinking the other day too that I was surprised I managed to listen to the entire class period completely attentive, typically I day dream and lose focus 3 times during an interesting class or pay attention for only 5 minutes out of the hour if its beyond boring. Sure, I get distracted easily when working on homework, often looking up to see who just walked by or who made that noise or just dropped a pencil, thats why I listen to music *constantly* (because I love music but I also like drowning everything out). Sure, I need to be doing two different things at once, like solving a Rubiks cube to keep my hands busy while watching Parks and Rec, or listening to music and drinking coffee while writing and essay, but at least that latter part is normal, right?  Thing is though, my homework has never been late,and Ive never shown up late to class. Yes, Ive forgotten to do a quiz or two, yes, I misread assignments sometimes and do them wrong, yes I skim read textbooks or dont read altogether, yes, I worry about forgetting my books or misplacing my keys or wallet so I make sure to leave everything in the exact same spot every night. But everyone does that, right? Sure, two weeks ago I left my jacket in a classroom and didnt notice for four hours and then also couldnt remember what classes I had that day or where I left it. Sure, weekends are often unproductive because I feel like I have a ton of time to work on stuff and end up finding myself going from reddit to Facebook to YouTube and reading up on random things and spending more time writing this post than working on a big project due soon, but isnt that typical for college students?   Sure, Ive probably spent 7 minutes on Duolingo, yes, I cant seem to work on the novel Ive been trying to write for 3 years, yes, I put off calling places to see if they offer summer jobs, but the important stuff I finish almost weeks before its due because I stress out about how much time itll take (though usually it takes little time and my stress was for nothing).   Yes, I interrupt people sometimes, and yes, as a kid Id talk on and on about the most random things, but thats why I am so quiet now, I fear people dont care what I have to say or will leave me like most friends eventually do.   Sure, I spend impulsively, and yes, sometimes the desire to order something on Amazon RIGHT NOW is so strong Ive probably spent two hundred dollars or more a year on books Ill never finish. But Im never late (the social   would kill me, showing up late), I never forget to do assignments (I often stress about them weeks before theyre due), sure, whenever I finish an essay I tend to skim over it, lacking focus to check for grammar, and yes, often my writing is decent, but it is usually unorganized with some grammar issues. But I love writing, I love the ""flow"" that comes from putting out my train of thought (ah, that might be the hyperfocus, and yeah, thats whats happening right now as Im typing, Ive written all this crap in the span of 30 minutes because its interesting to me whereas I go between Netflix and homework every other five minutes).   Sure, if I dont drink two cups of coffee a day I get restless and lack focus, sure I stay up later than I intend to but if I try to go to bed before I actually feel exhausted Ill have trouble sleeping. But thats normal for college students, right?        TL;DR  Im worried I have   but Im also worried that Im overthinking. Theres things I completely relate to but I especially do not relate to late assignments or showing up late to places. Yes, I often make careless mistakes. Yes, the more I think about it, right now, showing up late to places, I show up late to things that arent as important, like going to a friends house, Ill misjudge how much time it takes to get there or misjudge how much time Ive spent before leaving. But, I have a few friends Im almost positive are  , people who are much more impulsive, jittery, restless, interrupting, and talkative. Everyone I talk to thinks Im just overreacting and overthinking, that I struggle with typical college student things, but I also think a diagnosis of   would explain so much its almost exciting and comforting to me to have this reassurance that Im not actually lazy instead of it being worrisome that I have a disorder (well, I knew something was wrong with my brain).

Thats why I also always thought that my ADD was what made me feel drained after work or after spending too much time with other people (even if I really like them and enjoy hanging out with them), until I just found (literally an hour ago, some links below) that I was wrong!

I dont know how I went 33 years before finding out what it really means, but I do remember people telling me that I was extraverted because I do most of the time have an upbeat personality, Im a journalist so being shy and scared of people isnt going to work.

There are plenty of occasions when I have both the time and the energy to take a shower but for some reason I talk myself out of it or procrastinate until I no longer have time for it.  Here is how I think about showering now:  I’ve decided a shower is not “just” to get clean. If i have a sore neck, a shower will help with that. If I have a stuffy nose, a shower can help with that. If I’ve had a long day and I’m stressed out, a shower relaxes me. Sometimes I tell myself I don’t even have to use soap if I don’t want to, I can just stand under the relaxing hot water (I always end up using soap). I don’t use shampoo every day because my hairdresser told me it’s bad for your hair to do so anyway. Those days seem less onerous. 😆 But that also makes “shampoo days” more fun.  I pick any of these reasons (or all of them) and I’ve been showering much more consistently. But more importantly, i feel like I have a healthier attitude toward showering as self-care.

2843,8-bitballer,0.0,I think my ADHD is preventing me from getting a job.,"First time posting here, bit of a rant/looking for advice.   Yesterday I received two more rejections from companies I had been interviewing with, one of them I made it to the final round with HR. I’m graduating college this May and I can’t tell you how many companies I’ve had interviews with, even big ones like Google.   I feel like the reason is because of the way I talk. Every time I speak the words are so jumbled and mixed up it’s a wonder anyone understands what I’m saying. I have what I want to say perfectly laid out in my head but then can’t seem to replicate it when I actually talk.   I’ve been trying to get better at interviewing, I even did practice ones with my school. It’s just demotivating seeing my friends and classmates get great job offers after only a few interviews.   Has anyone else dealt with this and found a way to improve the way they talk?

I also keep arguing in my head long after the argument is over. And whats worse is that while Im angry, I know im making too big a deal of things but I really have trouble letting go.   I wouldnt say I have anger issues because Im not angry very often and I never get agressive or abusive (Im mostly pouting like a baby), and its not preventing me from having healthy relationships of any kind. My problem is mostly with the inability of letting go of negative emotions.

2854,LeaChan,0.0,My therapist just refused to take me because I was 15 minutes late to a 1 hour appointment but still expects me to pay and I'm completely beside myself,"Ive been having an extremely hard time lately because not only am I dealing with my   since always but my depression has gotten significantly worse for reasons I still dont understand.   I eventually looked into therapy because my family was concerned and found a lady that seemed nice. The first appointment went okay and she did give me some weird vibes in that she was very quick to get frustrated with me if I got distracted or side tracked, but I was desperate for help so I didnt want to leave over it.  So, I started Wellbutrin a week ago and its been kinda messing with my sleep. I couldnt sleep at all last night even with trazodone. I accidentally fell asleep before my appointment and woke up at the time I was supposed to leave, left immediately and got there exactly 15 minutes later.   I rush upstairs then open her door and shes laying on the floor with a pillow and blanket. She popped up, got all embarrassed then said because I was 15 minutes late my appointment is over. I was extremely confused and asked why I couldnt just speak to her for 45 minutes and pay for the hour and she said thats just her policy.   over and over, she just kept saying it was just her policy. I asked why 15 minutes? Why does she not expect her patients to make mistakes like this considering theyre going through a lot? what makes her think this is even remotely reasonable or ethical when Im literally standing there crying and begging her to let me speak to her? No matter what I said, she responded that it was just her policy.   She then specified that even though my appointment has been canceled she still expects me to pay... I was standing right there in her office with 45 minutes left before her next appointment and she looked me in the eyes and told me that my appointment cant be carried out and I must pay regardless.  Ironically, I forgot the money as she only takes cash for ""the safety of her clients"". So, I told her I would bring it later but Im not interested in scheduling another appointment. She just nodded and I left.   Im completely beside myself. I keep crying because I feel so guilty for accidentally falling asleep and being late and also because I needed to talk to her so badly and she just refused over and over.

2856,Maidenhairgrapefruit,0.0,Day two on Vyvanse has been bad bad bad - advice?,"Yesterday I posted that my son’s first day on Vyvanse was great… And it was! He was a little hyper and fairly emotional around when it wore off but otherwise a great day.  Today we took it at the same time, with food. He seemed ok at first but as the day wore on he got More and more irritable, had a few small outbursts that he managed to control. Then he just… Sort of lost it. He kept bugging me to go play somewhere he’s not allowed and I kept saying no. He got a time out and send you the whole time out ok but when it was over it was like he snapped and had a complete meltdown. We were in a busy town square with a playground and everyone was staring at him because he seriously was acting psychotic.   This is a kid that has never had a meltdown like this in his whole life not even when he was a toddler or preschooler. We finally had to leave the area because he was just screaming incoherently. He started to hyperventilate and begged me to pull over and hold him - and it scared me enough that I did. We sat in a gas station parking lot and I held my seven year old like a baby and eventually he managed to take some deep breaths and calm down.   I called the on call doc and they instructed me to stop taking it immediately and I’m just so discouraged. 😔 it wasn’t his normal doc and I remember her telling us it might take a week or two to even things out and he might be emotional but this was so scary and over the top.   I will call the office Monday for how to proceed from here but does anyone have anecdotal advice for me? I feel like we took one step forward yesterday and 20 giant steps backwards today.

2857,rockclimber98,0.0,"Felt like a failure all my life, finally started meds","TL:DR; was labeled as lazy and struggled, diagnosed with   as an adult. Life seems to be getting better.    Like the title says, I’ve felt like a failure my entire life, until very recently (I’m 22). Growing up, since as far back as I can remember, I was always the “lazy and forgetful” kid in class. I’d constantly forget homework at home, not do assignments, and so on. I did well enough on tests to get decent grades, and played it all off as “I’m smart enough to pass classes with no work, so why should I try?” Everyone kind of bought that, but in reality I was trying really hard and just couldn’t ever keep track of work/things.   Multiple times I heard from my parents that I was a lazy failure, I wouldn’t ever get into college, they were going to send me away to boarding school, etc... obviously as a child this hurt a lot. I ended up coping in high school by taking a lot of hard drugs often. I graduated with a weighted 4.0, which although good, was not enough and I felt like I could’ve done WAY better.  College was a different story. I spiraled out of control freshman year, and was suspended after finishing the year with a 1.2 GPA.  I couldn’t stay on top of everything, leading to me becoming depressed, leading to me being even less on top of things, etc... Again, I dealt with this by doing lots of drugs and binge drinking dangerously at least once a week. I went back to stay with my parents and started working full time as a software engineer. I did well, as there are fewer things to keep track of as a software engineer. After one year, I appealed my suspension to my college and got accepted back. My sophomore year was great (compared to my other one), and I ended with a 2.7 GPA, mainly because I was retaking classes from freshman year.   However, when I started taking new classes my junior year, I instantly fell back into my old ways. After one semester, I was told I wasn’t being suspended, but that my GPA was low enough that it would take too many years to graduate. I left, and again, found a job as a software developer at a small startup. One year later (now) I decided to go to a psychiatrist and see what was wrong. I’ve started taking wellbutrin and it’s helping a lot. He was not willing to start me on stimulants given my past history of substance abuse, understandably.  Throughout my life, I’ve had all the same issues we all have, forgetting phone/keys/wallet everywhere, losing stuff all the time, forgetting about big bills, mismanaging money, and so on. Growing up, my dad was bipolar and my mom was of the “its all your fault, mental illness is a choice” mentality, so I never got checked by any kind of doctor for mental issues, leading me to believe I was just fundamentally a lazy and useless person.  I’m not sure where I’m going with this rant, but it does feel nice to know what has been causing my life to feel different. Its great to be able to point to a diagnosis and say “that’s why,” and then being given tools like medicine, therapy, and tips/tricks to deal with it. I wish my parents had been willing to admit there was a problem rather than constantly berating me and telling me it was my fault.  Anyways, to all of you that read this far, thank you. If any of you gals and guys have any tips/tricks for someone just starting to deal with their  , I’d love to know them.  Thanks  PS: Its been so nice browsing this subreddit.

2859,sevenmist,0.0,I just need to release everything... ( really long post),"First of all, I apologize for this fuck ton of text. Ironically, Im posting this in a sub known for people having a hard time reading long post. I just think this sub is the best to post this knowing the people here could possibly relate to me one way or another. This is the only place I feel at ease (at the moment) to unload my shit to so please bare with me.   To start things off, I just got diagnosed with   around 3 weeks ago. I didnt know or even fucking realized that I had   my whole life prior to around 2 years ago. The only reason I realized I have   was when I was looking up ""memory problems"" and   was the top result. I. Fucking. Snapped. When I looked up  , I was just... stunned and a wave of emotions just swept me. I related so, so much to  ... I cannot, even now, express how strongly I felt at that moment. The biggest feeling I had at that moment was that there was finally justification for so many things...  Im always restless, I always fidget and squirm especially when Im bored. I feel the constant need to get up and just do anything else like walk around when Im not entertained.  Id get distracted by literally anything, my own thoughts (which can lead to execissive daydreaming), light through the window, background noises, oh look a bird is on the window how cute!!   Focus? What the fuck is that? Even if I just stay still to do something (and NOT be distracted) it feels like Im just ""mechanically"" doing something... As if Im putting effort but Im not actually aware of what Im doing... Hard to express, kinda like autopilot mode I guess. To elaborate, in the context of reading something, it just feels like Im reading the words and not understanding the meaning much (or at all). Jesus Christ, I cant even pay attention to conversations sometimes. Im ""listening"" but either my mind is thinking of other things, or my mind is putting the volume down on whos talking to me and I cant understand them. Id just reply with an ""okay"" or a half assed answer to a question that I didnt even really understand for fear of being seen as an airhead. And just have a general lack of in-depth understanding of the thing they are trying to convey. I cant ask them to repeat everything, that can just seem either rude or youre not paying attention (well, technically I am, unintentionally). And this happens too much that if I asked somebody to repeat everything I didnt understand - it would take a looong ass time.   Im not gonna elaborate on everything, but just a quick rundown (excuse me, I wanna blabber). Im careless af, give me an instruction and Id fail it no matter how clear! Cute cup, it would be a shame if it br- oops... Expert of accidentally hurting myself here, AMA! (jk) Difficulty prioritizing and organizing properly and shitty task switching. Im pretty sure I have to look up this person before reading the rest! *10 minutes later* Im pretty sure I have to look up the history of everything else before continuing! For obvious reasons, I adore babbling, sometimes with just literal nonsense just to babble, its an impulse really. I only do it around people Im really comfortable with or when Im alone.   General impatience and irritability. Im a damn fabulous volcano waiting to erupt anytime. BURN BABY BURN. Im especially irritable when Im frustrated/stressed or when I feel my symptoms more (you wouldnt wanna talk to me while Im too restless without an outlet).   The biggest motherfucker for me is being forgetful. I will misplace **everything** my hands are holding. Im holding my phone, the next thing I know it disappeared. Turns out I placed it somewhere. Alternatively, I knowingly placed something somewhere and then Id have to literally search the whole house to look for where I placed it (as I forgot where lmao). This is what I abhor the most, I forget precious memories.. I cant express this properly... It hurts so much I cant find words for it... I forget deep meaningful conversations that the other person would remember for life. I will forget details of things that previously happened in movies and shows. Or I could even forget what happens in a movie or show almost completely. I will forget things that I put so much time into, time researching various topics Im interested in all practically wasted - I cant remember much of it after a while.   Unfortunately, most stuff I like doing require remembering things. From researching various things like philosophy, psychology and law to watching anime. It doesnt help that my interest are constantly shifting. Id have a period of time where Im more research oriented, or Id rather just watch anime or some Kpop related thing.  This alone, forgetting things that interest me breaks me. I feel like I dont belong anywhere, I cant properly join a fucking fandom forgetting 3/4 of the story. I cant have a knowedgable conversation with someone with the same interest as I have (say, for example, psychology) as I forgot my shit. Im a filthy casual for most things, Ive never really gotten ""that into"" something the same way other people do. I dont need to watch every performance, know every fact and listen to every song that the artists that I like release. I like repeating songs anyway. Still, it severely bothers me forgetting so much of what I like. Ive become sort of apathetic in investing time to the things I know Ill just fucking forget.   With all these shit in mind, theyre dominantly the reasons why upon the initial realization of my   2ish years ago, broke me and I began to have severe depression. There was finally so much answers, so much things I realized about myself. So much justification for far too many of my problems.   I was bullied at age 7, stopped school for about a year. I enrolled in a good school that had a homeschool program, we still had stuff we had to physically do in school like test and various activities. Students perform at their own pace - I performed terribly. Apply the things that I wrote up there to school work, especially at an at your own pace concept and youve got yourself a nice dish. Im *terribly* slow compared to my peers, and I stopped for various reasons throughout the years. Off a year due to a bad year in finances, also stopped a while since I wanted to very desperately focus on my interest (hard to explain, I feel inclined to not let my interest slip away even if I end up forgetting them them anyways and wasting time). This came off as laziness, both for me and my family. Some frustrations also came into play in my ""laziness"" such as my frustrations in being academically slow. Im basically in and out of school. Now, I stopped again... Ive stopped for more than a year, crippling   wouldnt let me even let me write in a book. My frustrations and self-loathing is high enough to severely impact my life again. Fortunately, my   is tamed enough to let me write in a book. But my frustrations, self-loathing and my   are still severe enough to stop me from regaining my life. I cant imagine going back to school, for the I dont know what time already, and see my teachers, former classmates, classmates, friends in the eye knowing how much Im lagging and how much Ive stopped. So many of my former classmates have passed beyond me I find it the hardest to think about that...   Im several years behind my peers academically, because of the things Ive mentioned. Ive lied countless times already about my education to relatives and outsiders in general. Only my immediate family and a few other relatives know of my true situation and the things Im going through. Not even my god damn father knows the truth about everything about myself, were not that close and he lives in another country.   It doesnt help that I have so much family issues and other personal issues as well. From my older sister that constantly berates me for little things. I love her, shes probably my closest person right now, were alike in personality, interest and beliefs. Were like a pair of little kids together, but were a cat and a dog at the same time. She can be really intimidating, violent and toxic when angry... To my mother that can be insensitive and has never really been that understanding, caring and kind to me. To my grandmother that rejects my atheist beliefs and says general unnecessary comments. And my father thats never really been there for me, and often compares me to other people as ""advice"". ""There are so many people that have a bigger problem than you."" is not good advice. Due to my family dynamics, Im a bratty, irritable asshole to them. While to others, Im genuinely kind and caring person. Kinda had a identity crisis way back because of this distinction.   Im in therapy, its helped a bit with personal issues but not much for   related stuff. Im taking Concerta 27mg, still experimenting with the dose and possible addition of a non-stimulant. Or alternatively a small dose of stimulant meds throughout the day as a boost to my Concerta. Possible addition of anti-depressants as well if my depression gives me rough fucking anytime soon. Since most of my problems havent been fixed, my depression is at risk of coming back. I kinda feel it slowly coming back, hence this post. I already suffered relapse before, so Im taking steps to preventing a full relapse.   If you managed to finish reading this I very sincerely thank you. I genuinely thank you from the bottom of my heart. I know this was a long ass wall of text. I dont really know what I want to do with posting this. Attention? Support? Advice?

I took it for four years in my early twenties, but stopped when I finished my undergrad. Now I’m 28 and have begun a grad program (it will only take 1-2 years).

I know how much of a problem this is. I want to stop doing this, don’t know if I can, but this is a first step in admitting my problem so I can make a change.*  It’s also relevant to note that the amount I was prescribed was more during undergrad than it is now (different city and doctor), which I think contributes to the reason that I take additional.

So my doc originally prescribed me Vyvanse to treat my   and my b.e.d. I was on 20mg and noticed some small differences, but I noticed some negatives too, namely a very hyper feeling when first taking it, insomnia (I already dont sleep good so that fucking sucked), and a rather violent re-occurrence of my heart palpitations. I mentioned the palps to my doc and as a precaution she took me off the meds and told me to go get my heart checked. I was devastated cause Id been living with the idea that I was a serious flake for the past 20 years and a lazy piece of shit for the past 7 and this was supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel. Cardio checked my heart and the palps, which started when I had my son, were benign and just annoying. GREAT! Not so great my psych knocked me down to 10mg Vyvanse which was basically pointless though I understood why.       When I found out I could go back to my old psych I was stoked but at my first appointment I told her all my thoughts on the Vyvanse. I was a little nervous she wouldnt listen or would think I am drug seeking or something. But she listened. I didnt want to rely on meds for an eating disorder I felt I could conquer without meds for fear that if I need to come off for whatever reason (pregnancy for example) Id go right back to my old eating habits.   cant be cured, but b.e.d. can be. So she decided to switch away from the amphetamine family  and prescribed me Focalin, which is in the same family of Ritalin. Starting with 10mg XR and let me tell you this is soooo much better. No manic feeling, Im noticing more control in what I decide to focus on, I can SLEEP on this, and so far no palps. I also noticed my thoughts are less food obsessed even though its not for that, Im thinking it might have to do with being able to redirect my focus better. I work data entry and my numbers are even starting to catch up to my co-workers!     TLDR part 2: Focalin &gt; Vyvanse for me.

2900,sbea6,0.0,No meds is not a medical emergency- but what is?,"So yesterday I went to get a walk-in appointment at my doctors to get my prescription of Elvanse/Vyanse. I haven’t had any since Monday (of course) and haven’t had a chance to go earlier in the week. It closed at 10am and I got there with 2 minutes to spare when the receptionist told me that they had to shut the walk-in service at 9:30 am due to staff shortages.  Immediately my brain goes into overdrive and I ask to speak to someone else. She tells me there’s nothing they can do but I can be put on the list and wait an hour and a half. She also says that people with medical emergencies will be seen straight away- inferring that clearly whatever I was there for was not an emergency.  Now I’m not bleeding or writhing in agony so technically it’s not what this woman seems to be an emergency. As someone who suffers with mental health issues it’s fairly easy to picture someone suffering with serious   or depression who needs help that day walking out because they are made to feel like their issues aren’t important enough.   Since then I’ve been thinking about what qualifies as a medical emergency. People who need urgent attention may not always look as if they do and I think that more needs to be done for everyone in the medical profession to recognise the signs.  I was agitated, fidgety and on the edge of tears because I was so worried about not getting my meds yet no one seemed empathetic or apologetic. I was just greeted with a shrug and a ‘there’s nothing I can do’.

We share a psychiatrist, and he overlooked my   symptoms for YEARS and chalked it up to symptoms of my depression/ /bipolar/etc.  Now that he is actually treating me, it has been helping a lot.  However, Ive always struggled in college due to being unable to concentrate during lectures or when working on long term projects.   I know that Im smart enough to learn, but the way in which my major (computer science) is taught by my school directly clashes with my learning styles.     I am (was) one semester away from finally graduating.  Ive struggled through college, from putting myself through community college, to building my own credit so I could take out my own student loans (parents have bad credit), to living in crappy apartments with barely enough money to keep me afloat.

If so do you have any tips or tricks to law school, accommodations, study habits?  2) does anyone whos taken concerta feel that you dont notice that its doing anything to you until you dont take it for a day?

I also know that thanks to   taking care of yourself can be a pain the rear. And I was thinking about it earlier and realized that I kind of wanted to share some things that I do that make my life a bit easier, in case it can help someone else. I dunno, its late and this is what my brain decided to hyperfocus on. Enjoy!  * Have both mouthwash and toothpaste that are tasty. If you hate the taste of your toothpaste, what are the odds that youre going to want to brush your teeth daily? zero to none, I know how it goes. * Face wipes are your friend. Ive tried a million and one different skin care routines and none of them stick, because they all take too long. Wipe your face off with a makeup wipe before you go to bed and tada! Fresh and clean face. (Yes, you can use makeup wipes even if you dont wear makeup. Theyll get the oil and dirt off and take like a minute.) * Try and avoid buying completely new products when you run out. I know Im guilty of this, but when your shampoo runs out dont go buy something fancy and new and expensive. Try and buy something that you like. OR if you want to experiment have a list of scents that you enjoy, a brand that works for you, etc. Having something familiar in your routine makes it seem less scary. * Have a minimum routine for low energy days. Dont expect yourself to get up every morning, take a full shower, brush, floss, AND mouthwash, put on a full face of makeup, blow dry your hair, style your hair.... Im getting exhausted just typing all of that lmao. Have a routine that just covers the basics, and can get you out the door. For me it looks something like: brush teeth&gt; deodorant&gt; mascara &gt; ponytail&gt; DONE. Granted I try to do more on most days, but when you just cant, having a backup routine is totally OK and acceptable. * If you can, leave your stuff out on the counter. Ive noticed that for me, if I put my stuff away I forget about it and then have an excuse not to take care of myself. Having at least the basics out in the open is a good way to remind yourself to use them, and also to help your brain not consider it too much work to get ready. * Minimize your steps. Try and make sure that the stuff you need is in the place you need it. Dont make extra work for yourself by leaving half of your makeup in your bedroom, or storing your toothbrush in an out of the way place. Find the most efficient place for everything in your routine so you dont have to do extra work if youre already low energy. * Figure out your challenges. Find out what makes it hard for you to keep up your personal hygiene and work out solutions. I only shower in the morning, because I cannot stand wet, cold hair in bed. Its so important to know why youre having a hard time with something. And dont worry if your solution seems weird. If it works, it works, and thats all that matters. * Accept that theres going to be rough days. Sometimes even if you have the best, most energy efficient routine in the world, its just not going to happen. Dont beat yourself up. Go on with your day and try again tomorrow. Or later today. Or whenever you can.      OK, I think thats it. lol.

This only happened because of an issue with my insurance company that I wont go into.  I did not want to switch at first because I just started a new job but had to because insurance blah blah blah...  So the first thing I noticed was that my   almost completely dropped off. My heart rate is no longer resting around 85+ like it was on adderall (used to be in the low 60s and high 50s before adderall) on vyvanse my HR is now down in the 60-70 range. I no longer experience a major come down or headaches at the end of the day. I have my appetite back so Im feeling healthier and my mental energy is lasting longer through the work day (probably due to better diet and vyvanse).  I will point out that vyvanse does not give me the same level of focus at 30mg that 40mg of adderall did but I believe this is due to dosage not the drug itself. I have doubled the dose some days and still experience all of the positives (lessened side effects) while also having increased focus over my previous experience with adderall.   Overall vyvanse is a far better drug for me than adderall, Im just hoping that during my next appointment my doc will increase the dosage so I can maintain the same level of focus without having to skip out on some days just so i can take a larger dose on the days I really need it.

Currently on 50mg and after about 5 hours I get very irritable and the littlest thing sets me off. I recently went to my doctor and got prescribed 20mg of Adderall XR, but the effects during the period it affects me the most make me completely emotionless, and they dwindle altogether at about 4.5-5 hours and I get super tired and just end up laying in my bed doing nothing for 2 hours.

I live in Sydney and I have been to a psychologist who referred me to a GP so that I could be referred to a psychiatrist, who is now referring me back to a GP so that I can be referred to a   specialist. I can’t afford to pay for a specialist at the moment even with the medicare rebate, so I am hoping that a bulk-billing specialist will take me, though the psychiatrist who referred me has said that it will be unlikely. The people I have talked to have stated that I am likely to have some form of attention deficiency, though I will not be able to determine the severity of this for some time.  I have booked another appointment with the psychologist to try to figure out some non-medical treatment methods in the likely event that I will not be able to see a specialist, but this will be several weeks from now. I am hoping that I can get a head start on some behavioural methods to help me cope with losing attention and focus, and forgetting things, and misbehaving in social situations. I have had some success so far simply by being mindful of the times when my mind is drifting away and forcing myself to refocus, which has allowed me to actually sit through two lectures so far without losing focus (with the help of coffee). It is likely though that this habit will slip as I stop paying attention to my own behaviours. I haven’t been able to figure out good strategies in social situations. I’ve been trying to look at the person speaking and trying really hard to pay attention and not daydream, but I end up forgetting what they say anyway. Also with regards to work, I haven’t developed good strategies for keeping myself on task and being mindful of the time available.  Therefore, I am interested in finding guides that will alow me to take a more structured approach to dealing with my problems. I have gotten my hands on the Hallowell books and have watched some of the videos posted here, but I’m looking for something more direct than that.

2947,gracieIsNotGay,0.0,"I was diagnosed in 5th grade, and am now a Junior in HS. I've never dealt with the shame.","Ive never been able to put this all into words, nor do I ever think I have, which is scaring me a lot right now. Ill try to be brief, but absolutely no promises.  In the fall, about a third of my class went on a retreat. The aim with these retreats is for us to reflect on ourselves and the issues in our lives, so the whole experience ended up coaxing out a lot of feelings I like to keep under wraps.  I spent a lot of that time crying, but for the most part, it was relieving. I felt safe to talk about my issues with people who were in a state of viewing each other with compassion and understanding. It was a very open experience for me, and I still miss that small circle of my peers that we all had to talk to, with a vow of secrecy.  The only experience from that retreat that I struggled with, and didnt utilize this comfortable setting to vocalize my feelings on, was the rock exercise.  Right now its scaring me a bit at how difficult it is for me to write about this. At this point in writing this out I just paused and thoroughly edited everything Ive just written to procrastinate. Even now Im editing this little paragraph to death.  Anyways, the rock exercise. It was the way they phrased what we were supposed to do that really sent me into a spiral. I can remember the instructions so clearly (ironic because my memory is never this vivid when it comes to tests). We were supposed to take a rock and a marker to write on it with. The instructions, in the retreat leaders words;  ""On one side of the rock, we want you to write a challenge youre facing in your life.""  (  was obviously what came to mind the second he said that)  ""And on the other side, write the opposite of that challenge.""  Obviously, no one intended to cause harm with these directions. The thought process I threw myself into I blame no one but myself for. But either way, I just sat there, not listening anymore, chest hurting from the thought, my mind fucking racing.  ""Opposite of the problem? Being neurotypical. Being normal. Not being me.""  As almost an angry joke to myself, I scribbled down "" "" on one side, and ""a lobotomy"" on the other. As soon as I did it, though, I just hid the rock in one of my pockets, lest someone see it, and focused on breathing.  Freely crying wasnt so embarrassing on this retreat, and we saw openly sobbing as a  feature that we got to enjoy for two days only. Even with that sense of comfort, though, the breakdown I had over this fucking rock felt so incredibly different from the liberation I had felt in my tears when talking about other issues.  I spent hours cycling in my head about how there was no way I would ever be fixed. I would never know what its like to be normal. I will never know my identity without the harsh grit of my disorder mixed in. I will feel annoying, loud, disgusting, shameful, childish, lazy, and misunderstood for the rest of my life. I will never know the full extent of my potential because I will never be able to use my intelligence in the same way someone without   could. So many unexplainable feelings that I have never tried to explain until now absolutely wrecked me.  I tried to keep myself from crying, because I hated the idea of someone really pressing me about it, but no matter how much I tried, I spent the majority of our smaller group talk avoiding everyones eyes, dodging opportunities to share, and partially covering my face with my hair because I would lapse into that violent thought cycle over and over and end up just tearing up no matter how much I tried to control it. I couldnt share, and even the thought of sharing made my throat close up (even further than it had already.)  The shame is what held me back. I just didnt want anyone to know what I was having a breakdown about, because in anyone elses eyes, I thought I would seem fucking crazy. I knew, in my heart of hearts, that this was the biggest issue in my life, and how badly it affects everything I do and all the things I *want* to do, but I dont think anyone else would understand it, no matter how much I explained.  Even now, thinking about talking through my problems with someone else, I feel like itd be seen as a cry for attention, that Im making a mountain out of a molehill, that Im just someone who shouts ""squirrel!"" whenever I see one and that Im really just a child whos bad at paying attention.  Ive never talked about this. Any time Ive even begun to have that conversation with a therapist, it ends so quickly because my throat closes up and I cant speak and my eyes stay wet for hours afterwards.  I cant reconcile this feeling of brokenness. I feel like a fucking ceramic pot that broke, and my medication is just shitty superglue that holds it together but water still leaks through the cracks and theres chips in the glaze and those chips have that disgusting gritty texture unglazed ceramic has. Or even all over, just that shitty, awful, chalkboard texture. Thats how I feel and I cant explain it to anyone and it hurts so terribly to even think about.  Even worse, I already have a difficult time expressing my genuine emotions, and the topic of my   is the worst. In my minds eye, me talking about it, and how this pain affects me, and how I bottle it up, and how much loathing I have for my inability to just fix all of this through hard work, I just cant see it. I cant see it as anything anyone could take seriously. I see a crass, obnoxious, kind of weird, very crazy girl talking about her problems that no one wants to hear or deal with because theyre foreign and unromantic. I see the incredibly cringey kid that no one likes expressing her true feelings for once, and evoking a disgusted sense of pity out of those unlucky enough to have to hear her open up.  After writing all of this, now Im beginning to think about what I want. What the point of getting this out there is. Its mostly for myself, overcoming a barrier and sharing these feelings with people who may be able to understand.  I cant help but feel, though, that I am just wishing that by writing this, something will click, and Ill just be normal, or Ill figure out how to feel normal, even if its just a facade.  Its an unrealistic hope, and a more realistic one would be that I come to accept myself enough to not hurt so badly when really thinking about what I wrote about in this post.  Its so easy to direct this anger at myself, and to hate myself for all my failures, and for my inadequacy, and for my personality that I can never seem to get right, but Ill try and make it my goal to let that go. I feel like Im lying to myself and just avoiding the truth when I resolve now to try and accept myself, but I hope by this time next year Ill look back from a place of growth and confidence and be able to say that I dont feel like this anymore. Not through a drastic change in my personality, like I regularly fixate on, or by becoming the perfect student, like my parents want, but more through doing what makes me happy and through seeing my flaws as hurdles on this stupid race track of life, rather than these impenetrable walls.  Writing this out has been good. Its not fixed. This hurts. This isnt a happy ending, I just felt like I needed to write a conclusion, and distancing myself from that memory put me in a slightly more progressive mood. Anyways, to go back to that rock bullshit, if anyone would like to see a picture of my self hatred rock, [here she is.](https://imgur.com/a/TkEmrim)  For anyone who bothered to read this, thank you.

During my childhood, from elementary school to high-school, I got really bad grades (got D’s and F’s in elem-middle school, then graduated with a 1.95 gpa in high school, was also suspended several times through this). I’ve also been recommended to be put in the special education class in high school when I went to see a psychologist but I refused. I used to be EXTREMELY hyper as a kid, ex. Super talkative (got into trouble numerous times), however, my dad was pretty abusive when he was drunk, while I was growing up (verbally and physically in the house, there were numerous times when police were called and my mom forced my sis and I to go to a random neighbor’s house while my dad started throwing everything), which I suspect is responsible for my general social   and depression. Thing is, I’m not quite sure if I have   and I’m worried of the stigma of going to see a psychiatrist for it. I also have trouble differentiating between the common symptoms of   and depression. Can you guys look at my situation and see if it and the symptoms are significant enough to warrant a visit to a psychiatrist?  Here are the common symptoms that I’ve noticed:   1. Running thoughts (I can’t keep a straight line of thinking. this is REALLY noticeable when I’m studying, when I’m trying to go over a concept and I can’t keep my logic consistently, resulting in me studying much more to get concepts than my classmates)  2. Sometimes, I say words incoherently when talking to people which makes them confused (I get pretty anxious when talking to people, and I start over-thinking and talk faster than intended, which makes me start slurring and messing up my words)  3. I’m really forgetful. I’ve lost my wallet, my university card 3 times so far this year, and just generally. I’ve started looking for my phone, when I was watching a tv show on it right in front of me. I recently opened a savings account, and had to deposit a certain amount by this Thursday, which the banker emphasized, but I obviously forgot (2 times now)  4. I’m pretty quiet but I’m really restless. I have a tendency to incessantly tap my foot and wiggle my toes.   5.

Also my stats teacher thinks Im dumb but I  proved him wrong by doing well on an exam  I **never** done well with writing assignments.  I think it was because my thought process is all over the place and I cant filter anything out so the writing would be almost incoherent.

It takes way longer than it needs to, but it is not time wasted so I dont beat myself up about it.

I keep thinking of the Monk thing ""Its a gift, and a curse""  Also unrelated but ever since I notified my stats professor of my academic accommodations, he treats me like Im dumb.  Hell explain something and then single me out and ask if I have any questions.  Like in front of the whole class, several times a class.

My two brothers, mother, and grandmother all have  , and as a 22 year old female, I never knew my symptoms were related to it. I made decent grades, so I was never tested. I never really put up a fuss, and I was agreeable, yet unrealistically active and ""sensitive,"" so fortunately/unfortunately for me, I blend in. Yet, to this day I have suffered from an inability to stop thinking, stop going, pay attention, sit down, calm down, complete tasks, to remember, to connect with others. My hyperactivity, although stressful and   provoking, has made me successful. I thought everyone was trying this hard, and thats especially painful. I have what seems like thousands of painful memories coming back to me in an entirely different perspective where my symptoms were exacerbated. My teachers, family members, coaches, and so many people I trusted treated me like shit for things I wasnt necessarily aware of. This is not to say the responsibility isnt mine, but the realization is painful. I also am having a hard time accepting that my family didnt question it because the results were positive in a parents perspective. My father is also dually dicked with ASPD and NPD, so Im sure that didnt help.   A difficult part of this is apologizing to my fiancé for all of the emotional outbursts that I believed were completely justifiable. He has  , but hes more inattentive, so you can only imagine how lost we are navigating the beautiful mess of a dual   marriage. Im unable to stop focusing on some things that hurt sometimes, and my emotional reactions are so swift, so intense and disorienting. So cognitively blurring. I read about RSD (rejection sensitivity dys.) and ironically, I burst into tears. It feels humiliating trying to complete graduate school as a licensed mental health professional with  , and a family history of what appear to be intimidating diagnoses. Ive always wanted to help people and I am endlessly fascinated and distracted by all aspects of a clients unique and individual consciousness. I have never lost interest in it, unlike almost everything else. Yet, I hope that maybe this realization will equip me with the ability to consider all aspects of life for my clients. I am a black female too, and doctors never take me seriously or consider what I have to say. They always tell me that Im fine, I need to rest, de-stress, be mindful. Ive had a doctor recommend me Claritin and then found out my entire lung was infected, so naturally, I feel distrust. Im in therapy, I exercise, I meditate, I try to sleep well, Im fucking trying. Yet yesterday I left chicken in the oven for three hours while getting no homework done because the Sims 4 had sucked me into a timeless vortex. I missed class Monday because I had begun painting and looked at the clock too late. I feel defeated. I want to see a doctor but Im afraid they just wont believe me. I want to show this post to my therapist so she can refer me to a psychiatrist, as that is what I would want my clients to do if they needed help. But Im still overwhelmed by all of this, and I know how I can get. The fact Im overwhelmed by all of this is making it harder to focus on the variety of options and choose a direction.

I admire them for a lot of reasons, but one of the things I appreciate the most about us is when they are blatantly honest with me. I’ve gotten upset with them for calling me a procrastinator and saying that I use my   as an excuse, but they’re right. I DO procrastinate and I have used my   as an excuse.   We got into an argument through text the other day and agreed to speak in person. During the argument, they said that they wouldn’t be able to deal with me and I was pissed. On Tuesday, we talked and, as heartbroken as I was, they kindly stated that being in a relationship with me would drive them nuts. I kept accusing them of being scared of commitment and being intimidated by my passionate, assertive personality (they’re very laid back and relaxed) and they kept trying to explain to me that they do like who I am and they do have feelings for me, but my tendency to be late with everything I do, my emotional outbursts, and the fact that I try to justify it with just having   is why they don’t want to be in an established relationship with me.   I was pissed and extremely depressed over the past few days and it didn’t dawn on me until yesterday, when I was talking to my therapist about the situation. He subtly mentioned that **having   isn’t an excuse, it’s an explanation.**  I thought it over for a while and the lightbulb didn’t go off in my head until an hour ago. There have been times where **my   is a valid excuse for something, and there have been times (too many) where I don’t actively work towards improving my punctuality, or eliminate obvious distractions that cause me to procrastinate, and I will defensively state that it’s because of my  .**   They’re understanding of the fact that I have  , but they know that I have the ability to improve these things. For example, I used to be really unorganized and not a morning person, and in January, I started disciplining myself. I forced myself to wake up by making it hard difficult to stay asleep, by cranking up the heat in my place and setting an alarm for like 2 minutes before an even time (4:58AM, then 5:00AM) and I spend the two minutes in between to procrastinate (reading emails, scrolling through reddit, fake-shopping on Amazon or a clothing app, finishing a task from the day before, etc.) and then I leave my bedroom at 5AM and start my day. I did this for a month and I became a morning person. I became organized by prioritizing it (saying “if you don’t do it now you never will so just fucking do it”) and putting it on my to-do list. They know how my hyper-focusing has helped me, but I don’t hyper-focus on the things that are important in a healthy relationship.   It’s unfair for me to make them feel like they have to put up me and my lack of will to work on those three really impactful things. I made the mistake of questioning the authenticity of their feelings for me because, at one point, they heavily considered wanting to be in an established relationship with me, but now they want space from me. They’ve even said multiple times that they feel bad for not wanting a relationship with me and hurting me, but I don’t think they should. I’m grateful that they’re still willing to be friends with me after I was so inconsiderate and manipulative about the whole situation.   I miss them a lot and I hate that I can’t see them or talk to them, but accountability is important, and it’s part of why I love them so much.

I am not interested in trades (welding etc) and am not a teacher, salesman, or leader. I dont always vibe well with people because I am not naturally bubbly.   Im a great writer (but only like creative writing), and am good at strategy and can be pretty vicious if I need to be. But I am mostly a creative/artsy who loves making with things. I would probably like to just work on projects all day and either make stuff or help people. I am terrible at listening, and any kind of support role or role of insignificance is an instant turnoff.   I honestly feel like nothing fits me just right and Im losing my mind here.  TL;DR: Stuck between three career options but feeling like there just isnt a fit for me out there.

2994,r3rider,0.0,Constantly indecisive about what career path to take,"I’m 28/f. Just realized I have   late last year and have been trying to manage how to address it and work through it since. Trying to find a psychiatrist/psychologist has been a mission and there’s so many things after reading through this subreddit that I’m like holy crap, how did I not know there were others like me?!   Every week it varies what   issue I’m dealing with the most, but a pretty consistent one is trying to decide what I want to do in life. As a kid I wanted to be an artist, then throughout high school I wanted to be a dentist (didn’t make any moves to do so and failed important classes in science). Since I had crap grades, I decided to just get a degree in biotechnology and see where that could take me. I still couldn’t pass classes I needed for that in community college, so I switched to business so I could transfer to a university.   I got my degree in marketing and graduated 2 years ago now. While getting my degree I decided I wanted to do dental hygiene and go on to get a second bachelors degree in that. So I got a job as a receptionist at a dental office. Hated it, so that changed my mind. I’ve only really worked minimum wage jobs from chipotle, Starbucks, dominos, and now currently in retail. Since graduating I’ve just been at the same job. I did have a marketing internship my last quarter of school, but hated sitting at a desk and have steered clear of any desk job. Although I have applied to hundreds to see if I could land a good job with a good company. Didn’t work out so that’s why I haven’t done anything with my degree.   For the past year, I’ve gone through ideas of being a personal trainer, police officer, starting a car detailing business, forensics scientist, back to looking for marketing jobs, psychologist, getting my masters in psychology then teaching/helping those with   and autism, being a behavioral therapist, then think I should just grow in my retail position/sales, now I’m back to wanting to be a personal trainer and possibly getting my masters in kinesiology... then I could even have my own customers and maybe open a gym one day.   I love working out and staying fit (not super hardcore into it because my job makes it hard to go often), but I used to go 5 days a week and I know my stuff for the most part when it comes to weight lifting/losing weight. I’m thinking of getting my personal trainer certification and if I really like it, go from there with getting my masters.   My problem is, I tell those I’m close to and then I lose interest the next day. Then return to my cycle of being indecisive and feeling like I’m sure I want to do something else!   I’m seriously driving myself crazy.   I know those with   deal with this a lot, but I’m struggling with it hard. Any advice on how I can choose something and stick to it for once?

I know that   causes problems with impulse control -- what can I do to help with this particular kind of impulsiveness?  For example, last night my wife had prepared dinner for us while I dealt with our mountain of dishes. She was making stuffed bell peppers, and had offered to eat the smaller bell pepper and leave some of her stuffing outside of the bell pepper so shes still get a good portion of stuffing. I told her she could have the larger bell pepper to get in more veggies, since she is trying to up her vegetable intake. (For reference, were both women and about the same size.)  Heres where I messed up: She takes the bell peppers out of the oven, puts them in their bowls, and adds some of the sauce from the container they were sitting in. I asked ""is that the extra stuffing?"", and she told me no, it was sauce. (In retrospect, I guess my first mistake was assuming she was going to put the extra stuffing in the oven with the bell peppers -- we had made the stuffing the day before so it was already pre-cooked.) She said we could microwave the remaining stuffing, and I sighed and said, ""No, I guess Ill just eat my portion here..."". My thinking in the moment was, ""this meal looks so good, and Im worried about the microwaved stuffing having a weird texture. So I think Id rather just have the smaller amount, though I wish there was a little more of it.""  Her initial reaction was to offer to give me some of her bell pepper or trade with me -- but at this point, I realized that her voice sounded hurt. Then it hit me that I hadnt even thanked her for putting the food together; I had instead gone right into criticizing what she had done as not good enough. I tried to backtrack, saying ""You dont need to do that, hon -- and thank you SO much for putting this dinner together for us; it looks and smells fantastic.""  But it was too late; the damage was done. When I thanked her, she admitted to feeling hurt by my initial reaction and I apologized, telling her what I had said was rude and thoughtless, that I felt awful, and that I was truly grateful for all the effort she had put in.   If it had been the first time I hurt her in this way, it might not have been such a big deal.

3007,PhantomFever,0.0,Can I ask questions about people with ADHD’s experiences with medication?,"Tl;dr at the bottom. Okay, I (33/f) have never officially been diagnosed with   (at least I don’t think), but I have been told by doctors that yes, they do believe I have it. I also believe I have it and oh how I wished I would’ve been diagnosed way back in elementary school. I went to a very small private school and back in those days and in that setting, teachers could say things that they’d be hung out to dry for nowadays. I think every single teacher I had from when I was in kindergarten through sixth grade told my mother to have me tested for   because they could clearly see it (mom never did bc I was just “full of energy”). Looking back, I feel so incredibly bad for my teachers and the kids I must’ve terrified, but I digress. At 21 years old I was prescribed the wonder drug Adipex (phentermine is the generic name) and the first week I started taking it it was as though the heavens opened and for the first time in my life, I sensed I had some semblance of control over my brain and actions. I was originally prescribed this because I was eating everything in sight and was gaining lots of weight. I was never not hungry. Adipex allowed me to eat like a normal person and the weight thankfully came off. However, when I stopped taking that medication three months later, I noticed a very bad change. For the first time I noticed what it was like to go from what maybe not having   felt like, to being plunged into an absolute mental and physical mess. For the first time I truly understood that I had an issue. So I was put back on the medication. And I have never tried anything else in over ten years. This medication is controversial bc of course it increases heart rate and doctors and nurses can freak out when they hear how long I’ve been on it. I go in every month to have my heart rate and blood pressure checked without fail. I have asked and asked my doctor about trying another medication but I’m always met with a nonchalant “if this is working for you, why change?” and/or, any other medication for   is going to do the exact same thing as far as increasing heart rate and blood pressure and they’re really all the same. Has anyone ever used Adipex/phentermine for  ? Does anyone have any experience with switching medications? Does anyone know if it is true in regard to Adipex working the same or virtually the same as other   medicines?   Tl;dr- I take Adipex/phentermine now. It’s helps, but I’m wondering if anyone has had any experience with this med for   and does it truly work the same as all the other meds out there commonly prescribed for  .

Resending paperwork, fixing typos, you know the stuff. The mundane and detailed, not very urgent, my worst enemy.

I still feel discontent. I wish that I could have been more organized so I dont have this fear that I messed something up or missed something. But I just wanted to get it done and take advantage of being ""in the mood"" so I got halfway thru my to do list, felt impatient and overwhelmed and just jumped in.

I’ve always had academic difficulties in highschool when it comes to studying consistently, practicing etc. and have started developing coping strategies in university but it still isnt enough.   Previously I had really terrible time management skills, planning, and couldn’t spend enough time working on drilling 100+ math problems (which is still pretty difficult for me but I manage practicing one topic well out of 3-4).  I am studying pure math, and CS at university at this time. I haven’t done as bad in CS but I make the stupidest mistakes when writing math exams, especially combined with some test   i’ve developed once i started university (it developed as a result of me having to rely on finals and exams to pass courses in highschool, so it really makes me anxious to write tests if theres a lot of pressure).   I really love my major, and I love math. I quickly grasp ideas and intuitively understand a lot of the material, but feel like Im not cut out for it anymore. I havent been able to fix this issue, I lost about 20 points (almost two full letter grades) on my most recent test because I was too focused on doing the topic at hand and completely miscalculated the final fractions ): Similarly, I also messed up evaluating an integral because I left something I thought I cancelled out and turned the question into an unsolvable mess.   When doing questions I think too fast and think up too many possible steps in my head, then end up rushing and messing up on things that arent directly related to the concept being tested. This has been a constant problem which I only just realized because before I wasnt studying for tests, so I would think I got a poor score because I didn’t know the material. Once I fixed that, I found that I also have this problem.   Even when I know the answer 100% I mess up. I saw a proof I was too excited to write out and missed a key step, I thought I wrote it down but I only did it in my head. I felt so stupid when I realized after the exam.  I already write in a smaller room, but I can never redo the test at the end, which is common advice but i never have enough time to do so, and I NEVER catch mistakes during my test I just cant make myself go through a question I already completed when Im writing an exam (working through a challenging problem set question is different though, I can get really into it). Also, I feel like Im never actually problem solving on the spot during the exam but my   spikes up the moment I run into a weird question and i spend 5 minutes freaking out. I don’t know if the problem is   or   or something else.  Has anyone had these issues? And if you’ve fixed them how did you do it? Time sensitive exams are a mess, but less formal in class quizzes I have never had an issue with. Does anyone have any advice on how to be a better test taker when you have  ?

3016,tiredteachermaria,0.0,Second guessing my diagnosis a little- because I’m doing well in my job!,"I got a position as a part-time math specialist, and I’m doing very well there. It makes me second guess my diagnosis- because I’ve actually been able to keep up for the most part!   I think the reason this job is so good for me is because it’s part time, and I change locations/activities about every 30 minutes.   I have noticed that there are still things I can’t do. I zone out a lot when I’m observing in classrooms and get distracted when I’m trying to plan in another teacher’s classroom. If I’m in one place for too long, I start to feel very sleepy. I graded some activities today for record keeping purposes(students that work with me aren’t graded for it) and barely spent 15 minutes on it before I lost focus. I’m late every single day no matter what measures I try to take to be on time. And in professional development I often embarrass myself because I’m fidgeting constantly and getting distracted, having to ask my neighbor what we’re supposed to be doing or what was going on.  But the majority of the job is so fulfilling and good for me. I spend most of my time tutoring small groups of students, which I enjoy over large groups. When I’m in the classroom, I walk around and give support to the students I often pull out. A lot of my planning is fun for me because I find education and math concept teaching so interesting! And my principal doesn’t monitor me very closely, so when I am late I’m able to just adjust my schedule so that I can spend extra time at the end of the day pulling out students(I often just tell admin that I had to adjust my schedule so that I could have the maximum amount of productive time and they’re fine with it... I’ve never been in trouble for lateness). Lately I’m only 5 minutes late at most(for a few weeks I could be as late as 45 minutes).   I’m trying to get into a full time teaching position, and I’m a little worried that I won’t do as well. But I am doing very well right now.

I told my mom about why I was going to the doctor because I had poor judgment and thought she would understand when I explained to her the symptoms (no mentions of  , just the symptoms). I want an assessment and thought she would sympathize, but I made a poor decision in thinking she was capable of listening or even empathizing.

My mom forced me to cancel the doctors appointment and yelled at me for wanting to go to a doctor to talk about my ""mental problems"" and called me stupid and naive for thinking people will help me. She ranted about how her sister with schizophrenia was drugged with medication and was always sleepy and thinks I want to drug myself. I told her it doesnt have to be medication and there were alternative routes like exercise or therapy, but she ignored me. She spent 10-15 minutes complaining about her bad experience with a psychologist and it feels like she wasnt listening to me at all or that she cared about me.

So many things I struggled with for so long and simply wrote off as normal or just a part of life seem to be common experiences for many people here and that is so incredibly validating after feeling like Ive been fighting for so long. Despite this, there are still many questions I have and things that Im exploring and trying to work out.      About two months ago I was prescribed adderall XR and it has absolutely turned my life around. Its definitely not perfect, but Ive found that I just have so much more control over how I live my life now, and can be a lot more intentional with what I let capture my interest and how I choose to spend my time and pursue those interests. I feel like Im no longer at the whim of my thoughts and emotions, and can rely on myself a lot more consistently to do the things that I plan and the things I say Ill do. Just in general, my life is so much more consistent now.     So my question is this: has anyone else here with   experienced difficulty in establishing an identity? Before I started on medication I would become interested in things and hyper focus on them almost obsessively to the point they would take over my life, and as soon as this interest would pass I would just drop this pursuit entirely. Pretty much rinse and repeat over and over again, which would make it hard to have any consistency in the things I do and who I am. Ive found since starting medication I have been much more confident and can have better consistency in the things I do, say, and think about, and I feel like all of a sudden Im playing catch up in establishing a more focused identity.     I in general have had difficulty with low self-esteem and a lot of insecurity throughout my life, and my psych believes probably some PTSD from when I was younger as well, so I wasnt sure if I just am experiencing this because of my depression or if this is anything anyone else out there has experienced.

I hope to gain some insight into my situation, and feel the people here will likely have some good input to offer.  I have had prescriptions for medications a couple times in my life, coincidentally these periods have also coincided with times of great difficulty on a personal/relationship level. It seems that in at least two previous relationships, whatever the u underlying cause of an issue would be, medications are the easiest scapegoat of problems. Ill admit to taking medications less seriously than I should have, but will not negate the fact that it just seemed like a handle to all of my personal problems to my, at those times, significant others.   I am single now, and not taking medications. This is what Ive observed:  Physical health is overall easier to maintain. I can regulate my diet with proper attention, making sure to keep up caloric intake, fiber, vitamins. I enjoy exercise, obviously endorphins are my friend, and have actually been able to gain/maintain weight with a lot of aerobic walking. I cook dinner a couple times a week, complete with protein, starch, salad, and canned veggies.  Mental health is fair to good, with outliers. There are also many extraneous factors here, such as a recent family member passing, and my relocation to a place where I have no existing friends.   I am well aware of an absence of linear, task based life management mechanisms, yet the day-to-day goes okay. I achieved a customer service management position through a lot of hard work. I learned that medication was not necessary to complete tasks like information organization and a few writing projects, if I could find ways to work around the inattention and need for outside stimulation. After all that hard work, I got fired from this job, for leaving the building for a few minutes as a supervisor. Awesome. I have a new job now, so Im not super hurt, but it was a major pain in the ass.  Career and academic goals are spotty at best. During my year of hard work at my last job, I got my student loan rehabilitated out of default, which is a nine month process. I was stoked to finish my associates, literally two math classes, and move on to a trade program. Got the FAFSA done super early for the year, and once it came back, learned that I had four other loans in default, so I didnt qualify for aid. Awesome.  My hour for writing this post is almost over, so Ill conclude with questions/conversation topics; and to say thanks for reading this far.   My main social motivation is to establish a relationship and find some friends. Mostly Im trying to find a gf though. Its hard to feel accomplished with student loan debt, and little to no career direction. This is a struggle. Im a very social and compassionate person, so Im kind of lonely.  I have just about given up on pursuing consul or medications, mostly because of misunderstandings and stressful situations that seem to happen at the same time. I feel like now I have a better environment, and a low-stress lifestyle that would lend itself well to therapy and maybe medication, but Im super skeptical. Its a lot of hard work to gain trust with a therapist, and the responsibility that comes with medication. I dont know if I could go through that again, but the student loan thing really hurt.  Wow I feel better already, nice to have this here. Thank you everyone and I would certainly appreciate any input you may have, about anything, seriously just talking about this makes me feel loads better. 🤔❤ ",1553878975,1553878976,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b6zsx8/adhd_wo_medication_balancing_physical_and_mental/,False,False,1.0

3035,kittycataddy,0.0,How to talk to my ADHD bf when I'm [non-ADHD] emotionally drained?,"Ive been with him for a year and a half now and I absolutely adore him. He is funny, intelligent, and capable of emotional empathy (though he has said he struggles with putting it in words, I know they come from a good place).  Now I do have PTSD and  /depression. And a lot of times I have to power through my emotional lows because I either talk too fast or I talk too much that he cant help but lose focus (I dont blame him at all for that). Of course, to a very flustered me, his loss of focus can be taken the wrong way. So I find myself avoiding him in these conversations. This does become exhausting given that we live together and he likes to push my buttons (as that is a part of his charm) when Im not necessarily in the mood to do so.  I dont have these emotional lows frequently but when I do, they are tiring and makes me view my relationship far more negatively than I should. I focus too much on how I am the only driver in the household, how I am managing the bills (he sends me money but I am the only one keeping track of it), how I am the only one who can cook, etc. It isnt that he doesnt do anything. He does laundry, washes dishes in the dishwasher, and cleans the cat litter. So it isnt that he does nothing for the house... it is just his first time living alone so he doesnt know a lot of things. But I feel awkward telling him how to do things because he either looks uninterested, feels as though it is stupid to do because takes too much time to do, or is stressed at the thought of doing it. It would be nice if he could take things off my load, but I also dont mind it because I understand why he cant.  Again I only have these thoughts when Im in an emotionally low state because of the heinous results of PTSD/depression. Sorry this post got really long but I know bottling this up isnt going to be a good method forever. Spo thus Im here on this thread asking... how should I talk to him when Im in these emotional lows, and not be so upset at him when he is just behaving because of how his brain is?

3038,Dingdong108,0.0,"First day, let's see how this goes!","TLDR: first day on   meds and how I started looking into my likely    diagnosis (I am working with a psychologist)   Hello everybody, since there are a fare amount of personal stories on here I figured I would share mine.  Basically I had a few instances at work of careless mistakes a few weeks ago that were just too much (had a history of these but none of them were major or greatly affected my work, but these were too much).  This led to a conversation with my father, whome I have a fantastic relationship with,  who also happens to have   and is in a similar field of work.  Explaining the mistakes I was making to him, I started saying it was like I was just missing things that I should be seeing, that I just overlook them, all things that are basic knowledge in my job, and before I said anything else he just said, ""stop, that is exactly how it feels when Im off my meds"".  Which led to me looking at quick online tests, several of them.  Answering the questions with my wife was quite an interesting process because of the laughter we both shared, not laughing at me but the revelation that about 90% of the questions were pretty much describing me to a T.  Talking non stop at times, constantly fidgeting/ tapping my foot, more interests in a month than most people will have in a life time and needing to know everything about them for about a week or two and then suddenly losing interest, having more projects on my to do list than the list of things I get done,  unorganized as all get out, forgetful of things that were just discussed, mind wondering when im having a conversation with someone to the point that Ive been told by my superiors that Im a terrible listener (construction, so things are not really ever sugar coated), being concerned that the conversation might change before i can say what I wanted to say to the point of interrupting people, and one that personally has caused the most internal struggle through out my life just being hesitant on getting started on things until last minute because they might be a more complicated task than Ive ever done before and will be a long task (ie home improvement projects, it was like there was so much involved I didnt know where to start even after hours of research on the project and knowing what had to be done).  My garage is perpetually messy because I go out there to start cleaning it but I start over in this corner and 10 minutes later I see something over here and start working on that and the cycle repeats itself until an hour or two have gone by and not much has been accomplished!   All of these things have been frustrating to me due to the fact that I did pretty well in school and would be seen as fairly successful in life thus far.   I got A/B honorol from the time I was in 4th grade, did well on tests most of the time, and didnt get into trouble.  Im 26 now and these things that I would see happening at work and in my personal life were starting to grow increasingly irritating to me because I knew I was intelligent because I did well in AP courses I was in and there was a high level of intelligence and what most would see as success on both sides of my family. About half of my family on one side are medical doctors, one cousin went to MIT, very intelligent mother and father (dads been tested by his psychologist to have an IQ above 150).  But despite my success in school I always felt like i was missing something, I couldnt hardly study outside of school without being distracted (reading things several times because my mind would wonder while reading it), pushing things off until last minute and procrastinating on my homework to the point that most of it was done at 9pm at night in a rush before I went to bed or until 10 minutes before the class that it was due in started.  Most of my writing assignments were finished at 3 a.m. Im afraid this might come off as bragging but just wanted people to know where I was at in life if anybody else could relate to it.  I had never thought about it being a possible case of   cause I had preconceived notions of what the symptoms were and never thought they applied to me.  (My mother in-law who has been an elementary school educator for 30 years always suspected it and mentioned it to my wife before, not in a condescending way, fortunate to have a good relationship with my in-laws)  After reading about it a bit and seeing that so much of what I read about it resonated with me I went to my family doctor. After talking to my family practitioner about it he felt that it was a good idea to get me started on adderall (10 mg twice a day).  I am seeing a psychologist and will be doing a course of testing with him in the coming weeks but my family practitioner was pretty confident in it.  I took my first pill about an hour ago, and will be filling my taxes today (something Ive been putting off until last minute because thats what I do, not for the express purpose of doing them with adderall lol).

No one will frown at you for taking a break from your tedious task to go pet the puppy; its *literally* your job (from a customer relations standpoint, anyway).  Now, from my experience,   hyperfocus is the bane of retail work and other jobs that require multitasking based on constant awareness of your surroundings (like looking out for customers lining up behind you). Since Im new, Im primarily up at the register, but Im also in charge of bagging live crickets since their bins are kept up front. Youd think I could take a second to look away from the crickets to see if I have a customer waiting, right? Of course not.

3061,EVMChaosti,0.0,Having someone say they hate you,"Just a heads up, this might be a long post and for that I’m sorry.   Anyways, my wife and I had gotten into an argument this morning over the car ( because I had to fix it again after it just got out of the shop), and I was frustrated from the car. Frustrated from remembering all of the homework I have to get done. Just life as a student you know. Fast forward a bit, we are picking up one of the kids she babysits, and the steering starts acting up. Making it hard to turn, frustrated I yell stupid effing car. Try to turn into a parking spot with the steering fighting me, and see that I’m really close to hitting a car, so I quickly( as best as I can) turn the wheel to get into another spot.   Wife then goes on about how I’m driving like an idiot, and how she hates me. Because I’m always angry and yelling about small things. And always taking it out on her. Having her say I hate you this morning just added to the already stressed and pain in my ass week I’ve had.   From loosing my wallet Monday after one of my classes, and dealing with the stress and   from that. The constant gripping I get from her about how I’m always aggressive and alienate everyone, and that no one wants to hang out with us because of it. Stress from trying my best every day to not maybe once let my emotions get out of hand, and often failing. Just all in all, I’ve been going in a downward spiral mentally for the past month now.   I don’t have anyone I can really talk too, no good friends, family doesn’t really care, and when I do try to talk to my wife, the moment I get emotional, I get told I’m yelling at her all the time. Just for clarification aside from my   I’m also deaf, I do wear hearing aids. So my volume control is iffy at best.   And dealing with all the stress, I’ve been dealing with a lot of self-hate. Constantly telling myself I’m a fuck up, I’m not good for anything, this is why you don’t have friends. Everyone hates you, you know the normal with social   and general   and depression.   Now I will admit, I’m not perfect, and I DO try to keep my anger and other emotions from running wild, and try to keep my impulses in check. Though I often fail, I do still actively try. But damn, having your wife of 6 years say she hates you just sent me spiraling even more. Your wife who helped you to understand that you have   and to get properly diagnosed and medicated. The one who says she understands  , only to turn around and act like she doesn’t.   I feeling myself get ever closer to my breaking point, and I fear this time it might not go so well for me. Not kill my self bad, I fight daily to never return to that point after the first time. Because I’ve seen the joy life can bring. Idk I just feel so alone right now.

3079,noewhit,0.0,A couple questions about medication,"So I recently (start of this week) began taking 10mg Adderall XR. Previously I was on a week trial of 5mg IR, a week without it for comparison, and now this week. In summary, I noticed a good difference with the 5mg, but XR sounded like a better fit.  XR seems to be working great too, I get sleepy when I should, dont take too long to fall asleep, and the only thing I have noticed is my heart rate will sometimes go from its usual range of 78-82 while resting to, yesterday, 100+ (116 was the highest) while I was just sitting during a classmates project critique. It was dancing between 96 and 110 for most of the time. It felt like my heart was a little nervous even though I wasnt, which was why I checked my fitbit in the first place. I was a little shocked but my bpm gets that high just taking a single flight of stairs so I wasnt very worried. This was within three hours of taking it. Bpm wasnt quite as high the rest of the day but was a little higher than usual.  Additionally, I plan to skip taking medication Fridays and/or Saturdays as both of those days it doesnt seem necessary for me. This would probably be weekly that I skip at least one day.   1. Is that weekly skip okay? What should I expect? Is it fine to just randomly skip a day where it feels unnecessary?   2. Is there a point where I should be concerned about my heart rate? When I am lying down in bed it is usually 78, rarely can get as low as 68 when I am barely even awake, and it is generally in the range of 80s during my day (unless out-of-shape-me has to put in a little physical effort for something)  3. Also, I am a case study for a friends health and nutrition class. Shes going to be building a work out routine for me and I was wondering if its okay that I exercise while on a stimulant that seems to make my heart rate jump that high? My mother has hypertension though I do not, and my doc didnt seem worried about that fact so I figured I shouldnt be too worried either. I just have an assumption that working out and taking Adderall might push my heart a little too hard.  Please let me know any of your experiences!

Inside, it says:  &gt; Human Studies In a human abuse liability study, when equivalent oral doses of 100 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and 40 mg immediate release d-amphetamine sulfate were administered to individuals with a history of drug abuse, lisdexamfetamine 100 mg produced subjective responses on a scale of “Drug Liking Effects” ""Amphetamine Effects"", and ""Stimulant Effects"" that were significantly less than d-amphetamine immediate release 40 mg. Intravenous administration of 50 mg lisdexamfetamine to individuals with a history of drug abuse produced positive subjective responses on scales measuring ""Drug Liking"", ""Euphoria"", ""Amphetamine Effects"", and ""Benzedrine Effects"" that were greater than placebo but less than those produced by an **equivalent dose** (20 mg) of intravenous d-amphetamine.  It seems that it is using a 2.5:1 conversion for Vyvanse to Dextroamphetamine Sulfate, or a 0.4 Vyvanse to Dexedrine conversion factor.

What is the correct conversion here? It seems that 28 mg of Dexedrine isnt very high.  My theory is that Vyvanse has a bioavailability of near 100% due to cleavage of L-lysine in the bloodstream, which is different than Dexedrine, as it is dependent on stomach pH, which reduces a portion of the drug actually getting absorbed.

I’m a 28 year old medical school applicant currently studying for the MCAT this summer and I was recently given a prescription of Adderall from my doctor last week because my concentration level has seriously dropped over the past few months.  So today I went to my local pharmacy (Walgreens) and I was told that I needed my doctor to provide a prior authorization form to my insurance company. Then I called my insurance company Meritian Health (basically Aetna)  and they said that once my doctor provides the form then I’ll be receiving a decision with a few days.

Inside, it says:  &gt; Human Studies In a human abuse liability study, when equivalent oral doses of 100 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and 40 mg immediate release d-amphetamine sulfate were administered to individuals with a history of drug abuse, lisdexamfetamine 100 mg produced subjective responses on a scale of “Drug Liking Effects” ""Amphetamine Effects"", and ""Stimulant Effects"" that were significantly less than d-amphetamine immediate release 40 mg. However, oral administration of 150 mg lisdexamfetamine produced increases in positive subjective responses on these scales that were statistically indistinguishable from the positive subjective responses produced by 40 mg of oral immediate-release d-amphetamine and 200 mg of diethylpropion (C-IV). Intravenous administration of 50 mg lisdexamfetamine to individuals with a history of drug abuse produced positive subjective responses on scales measuring ""Drug Liking"", ""Euphoria"", ""Amphetamine Effects"", and ""Benzedrine Effects"" that were greater than placebo but less than those produced by an equivalent dose (20 mg) of intravenous d-amphetamine.  It seems that it is using a 2.5:1 conversion for Vyvanse to Dextroamphetamine Sulfate, or a 0.4 Vyvanse to Dexedrine conversion factor. Elsewhere, I have seen this document: http://www.uacap.org/uploads/3/2/5/0/3250432/stimulant_equivalency.pdf State a  0.2948 Vvyanse to Dexedrine conversion. What is the correct conversion here?

How to deal","TDLR: dealing with a polar opposite ADHRer at work in a small office where we are often by ourselves. Hes untreated and Im treated, but hes dragging me down with him. He drives me nuts. Any suggestions to help deal with him?  Started a new job almost a year ago in an office of 5 ppl. I have inattentive   and am a classic hyperfocuser. Im taking meds and am working towards bettering myself with   by eliminating distractions, trying to organize my work, learning to focus on the task at hand without hyperfocusing, etc. Im also a quiet, introverted person.  My coworker could not be more the opposite. He  is the hyperactive type. Weve talked about   before so I know he has it and it is blatantly obvious  He cant keep still, constantly interrupts me, is so LOUD and is always on the phone talking super loud to ppl. And he can be quite obnoxious, rude, thinks hes the king of knowing how to handle ppl, and extremely impulsive but thinks it is the way he should handle things and I am wrong to wait and reflect.. He clearly does nothing to control it and is not on meds because hes against that sort if thing.  Because we are often alone in the office because our other co-workers travel often, I am stuck/trapped with him. Cant get my work done and because we have a decent relationship, I tell him hes being loud when I close my door. I tell him when Im super busy and cant be interrupted because it sets me way back on my concentration, etc. But he still constantly crosses the boundaries and Im not outright mean or state what I need in the moment when he bothers me. Like hell still knock on my door when it is closed or call me on the phone (we are 15 ft away from each other) to tell me about a good idea for Valentines day plans. Its never-ending. And I find I get nervous and cant work because Im just anticipating the next interruption.   Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this? My boss knows exactly what is going on and has basically thanked me for putting up with him and ""babysitting"" him. I cant seem to set boundaries with him. Hell be good one minute and then forget about any self control the next. I feel like we are opposite sides of the same coin. So weird how   manifests so differently in ppl.

More therapy. Online CBT also.  * Returned to work fully - phased through October, then compressed hours.  * Changed jobs in December - new field, short commute, no management responsibility, opportunity to expand on data analysis skills in an otherwise easy-for-me job in graduate recruitment. 80/20 split of the easy stuff and the data.  2019 * Not succeeding with the data analysis - in fairness to me, I was not given initial training on the systems or methods needed despite my weaknesses in this area being a known quantity from the outset, but in fairness to them, I was also making lots of simple mistakes and not catching them/lacking the context to understand them fully. The rest of the job - acing it.  * Diagnosed with  -I in February after 5 years on various waiting lists - now on 36 of Concerta XR and it’s working really well  * Probation extended from initial 3 months to 6 months (end of May)  On one level, I know I’ve had... just so much going on, pretty much constantly. I feel like I finally hit a limit-break in 2018 and decided, proactively, to really change my life. Taking time off sick was the first step in this. I had EMDR, my therapist was amazing, it really helped.   Changing jobs, trading seniority for work life balance and a new skill set, all felt like the right choices - hard ones, but the right ones. Now... it feels like I was doomed either way. Last job would have killed me with stress. This job... well, I might not have it come May, no matter how hard I’m working to improve. I feel like I gave up stuff I was proud of, but maybe toxically proud of, to make some needed changes... all for nothing.  I just feel like... so much has been happening, and like maybe therapy would help, but ... I almost feel too raw to talk about it all? Every time I try to, I just start crying, and I don’t feel better from talking it out. I feel like I’ve talked most of this to death.   Now I feel like I have to go on a job search, again, and to maintain income levels, I’m going to have to return to a field of work that I worked hard to leave. It’s exhausting to think about. I feel like I can’t face that. I applied for one thing that I didn’t get an interview for (it was adjacent to my old field but not a service manager role) - that was fine but I just can’t face having to hold this tension between “invest in keeping your job now” and “invest in finding a new job pronto”.  I’m sure I will figure this out, but I just need some... idk understanding, and maybe some practical help to think it through from people who might get it.   TLDR:   I’ve had a lot of big life events happening, plus   diagnosis, my new job isn’t working out as planned, I might have to go back to a field that I was miserable in, I’m sad and confused and feel like all the work I did to change my life was pointless.",1553847858,1553847860,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b6unkj/under_pressure_and_struggling/,False,False,1.0

I find Concerta pretty effective, but just not as much as I want it to be so were still experimenting on the dosage. I still have *a lot* of trouble doings things I want to do, but in comparison to being without meds its a huuuge of help.   Im starting to question a lot of things, that its frustrating me. Things like, the nature of normalcy and   and what the realistic expectations of being on meds really are.     ruined my life, and is still continuing to do so, so my hopes are pretty much on the meds. I already started therapy for my symptoms and other personal issues even before my   got ruled out. Therapy has helped, mostly with my personal issues, but in terms of my  , not much. So Im really placing a lot of expectations and hopes on meds.   Im bothered by my own expectations of being medicated. Things like, ""would I feel like a normal person with the appropriate medication?"" And, ""what the fuck does normal even mean and feel like?"" continue to pester me.  I know its not realistic, to expect my   to completely go away on meds. Its not right to compare myself to other people either. I just dont know what my expectations should be...   I know Im overthinking. I dont usually overthink stuff, but   has fucked me on pretty much all aspects of my life too much that I just cant help thinking about these things. Sorry if it looks more like Im ranting than asking. I kinda really need advice and support from the wonderful people here that know first hand where Im coming from.

3104,khharagosh,0.0,My conflicted feelings on hyperfixation,"Ok. So I had a conversation with an (also  ) friend tonight that has me anxious and frustrated.   I have been an obsessive person all my life. I think a lot of us experience that intense level of interest for something. When it sits in your thoughts all through the day, especially idle time. When you cant get enough of it, and you get that unique sense of joy when immersed in it. For me, it was usually TV shows, comics, or historical periods. They can last from a couple weeks to months. You almost always want to bring it up in conversation and info dump to whoever will listen.  But after a while, the high starts to wear off. And then you get that odd sort of depression where you havent found a new special interest, but the old one is getting tiring and almost stressful.   Well, thats where Im at with my current one. Not to mention, it has a unique problem. Though this series is pretty long running and therefore has a ton of content, there is next to no online fandom presence. So all of the pent up energy and thoughts I get on it have no where to go. The social aspect is completely gone, and it feels isolating sometimes. I managed to get one friend of mine into it, and have been sending some in his direction, but Im getting the impression that hes starting to get sick of it, which is understandable. I told him that I appreciated the emotional labor he was giving me and that I didnt know what to do with my fixation. And then he had an attitude that surprised me for another   person. He kept telling me to just find something else to be into, and that he can limit his fixations to a day.   It just doesnt work that way for me. I can be into other things, but I have never been able to control when and for what I form an intense special interest. So him just telling me to ""find something else"" sort of felt like when people tell me to ""just calm down"" when I have  . It just made me feel embarassed, which I already kind of do because my current special interest is kind of silly and cheesy. My sister, who is also  , once pretty much said that she judges me negatively for my obsessions because she feels like spending that much time on movies or shows is a waste. She hyperfixates too, but on goals like getting a promotion or getting married.    Ive brought it up with therapists, but their advice was also along the lines of ""just stop thinking about it!"" And to be quite honest, Im not sure I want to lose it. Sure, the low period and info dumping on innocent victims and impulse buying can be a problem. If youre fixating on a fictional thing someone else is writing, youre basically placing your mental state in someone elses hands. When your brain is always thinking on it, it doesnt get the calm and rest it needs. It can lead you to glorifying people who shouldnt be glorified. But I love the high and creative energy it can give me. A few of my favorite paintings that Ive made were inspired by special interests. I wouldnt know all I do about, say, India during WWII or 1930s Jewish Mobs if I hadnt discovered the topics while exploring my obsessions. I dont know if I want to like things a normal amount. Would I even be the same person if I did?   I guess thats where Im at right now. I want a mental break, just a bit of calm. But I also want an outlet to express my feelings on my current interest without dumping it on one person. And i wish I had better control over how much my brain thinks on a thing, but I also dont want to lose the passion my obsessions can create and the creative work that results.   Also, I have an underlying   that I have depression and my interests are basically unhealthy self-treatment via distraction.

Now Im 25 and just recently Ive rediscovered   and I still feel like I check all the boxes.  Im not sure where exactly I want to go with this post. But anyway. From what I remember from my childhood Ive been called a professor for being so forgetful/chaotic (but smart). I remember a teacher putting a stopwatch next to me because I was too slow (yeah bitch I still remember that). I rarely did homework, hardly paid attention IIRC, still I aced the tests. In high school it was mostly the same - spent most of my time doing nothing and acing the tests. Im a smart guy so this worked pretty well most of the time. Ive tried some different studies after high school but it just isnt for me. I got work as a programmer, I spent a lot of my free time throughout school programming stuff. Im working as a freelance programmer and I think Im pretty successful.  Anyway back to the POINT.

Im impatient, quite impulsive, cant stop doing something while I should, easily distracted by thoughts mainly, procrastinate, bad at finishing things unless theres a deadline, never read instructions, dont worry about the future as much as I should, very forgetful, always late, my brain is a mess, a lot of times I dont feel like Im quite here when doing things, make dumb mistakes or plain forget to do things, and on and on and on  What bothers me most are two things.  1. I have a very hard time remembering stuff and I know it hurts the people I love when they have to tell me or I ask multiple times about something very important to them. Also its not good to forget work stuff  2. I always always always always feel like I MUST DO SOMETHING. I cant sit still. I cant just sit somewhere for half an hour and do nothing like most people can. Either my brain goes crazy thinking about stuff and I just stare into nothing or Im restless. Either one is technically restless I guess  For the rest I really dont know what is possibly the result of   and what isnt. Its just who I am. I asked my psychologist who I was seeing for   issues (but the sessions are over) and she said that I could get it looked at again if it was having a negative effect on my life.

I’ve enrolled and left college 4 different times. I’m extremely impulsive when it comes to purchases. I regularly walk into rooms and forget why I’m there. I lose personal items daily. I can’t pay attention to any job related duties for more than 2 minutes at a time. I can have a full conversation with someone and not recall what we talked about when it ends. I have a fairly volatile temper and general anger issues. I’m a workaholic when I can hold down a job.

I can hyper focus on things that I’m interested in for about a week and then drop them like they never existed. My taste in music, movies, clothes, cars, food, etc, changes weekly.

This effect can compound into me replacing more &amp; more good habits with bad ones, &amp; I want to be able to avoid/mitigate/manage it better since it seems to largely determine what kinds of things I end up doing with most of my time.  (If it matters: Im on Vyvanse now, &amp; switching over to Adderall soon. I dont expect any major differences, as Ive taken Adderall before to very similar effect.)  I already have a daily schedule for myself to make routines out of doing basic responsibilities like taking my meds, but when I get knocked out of sync I will often take a long time to get back on track &amp; I end up losing a lot of time &amp; energy to being unfocused &amp; distracted from my goals. I guess I want to figure out how to increase my success rate of sticking to my plans.  Do you have similar experiences with   medication &amp; routines? What approaches do you have to consistently maintain good habits? Any advice for someone like me? Thanks so much!

3115,freeofeverything,0.0,I got recently diagnosed with ADHD and I need some information on how to use it medication properly.,"Im 19 and i had to redo grade 12 because of failing classes and skipping many classes. I just couldnt study properly which frustrated me because I did not know why I couldnt concentrate. I also didnt do as good as i wanted to in semester 1 because of the same situation however i skipped less and just regretted me having to repeat another a year.  I thought I had   before but I thought to myself this was just an excuse of me not concentrating.  It was around semester 2 when i went to go meet a psychiatrist and did a written test including talking about my past. When he diagnosed me, he started giving me dexedrine 5 mg IR which really did work and i started studying more and started taking more each day. The most ive taken in a day was around 20-30 mg. By my next appointment he gave me aderall XR (10 mg). The first day I took it i didnt really feel anything however i was less distracted and could focus a bit but not too much. I took 15 mg of dexedrine in the evening however I still felt distracted and didnt get as much work done as I should have even though i felt a bit happier and less anxious (maybe i wasnt motivated but usually i would be).  I still havent taken a tolerance break because of some school work i have to catch up to including studying for different subjects. What should I do now? 1) Should I take more medication? (I dont want to abuse it tho) 2) How long should my tolerance break  be for the effects to come back as when i first started taking them? (I felt more euphoria even tho i know Im not supposed to chase after the ""high effects"")  3)How much medication do you think is best or what I should try? 4)I also am curious of the effects of taking this regularly and what the long term effects are for it. What changes will there be in my brain? Is it possible to get better? Any tip would be useful for me.

Im a 21 year old male, started on Ritalin 10 days ago, 20mg in the morning, 10mg in the afternoon. Is it normal to not really be noticing much from it?  Let me quickly give some more info, I have  , its genetic ive had it my whole life, I also have ASD (high functioning) and OCPD (high functioning), for the most part ive ""brute forced"" my way through life however I am currently attempting to build a software company and I was consistantly noticing I was getting distracted more, in an attempt to solve that I remembered I have   (I sometimes forget because ive had it my whole life its just normal to me) and my mother (also  , on dex) recommended I attempt medication.   Now as stated earlier I just started on Ritalin 10 days ago, issue is its been hard to tell whats form what. See my life lately has been nuts, were getting our first office, I met a girl who, within two and half weeks, I had feelings for, stressed the ever living fuck out due to not being good at processing feelings (what makes me good at my job makes me bad at relationships), then hurt me by using those feelings for fun while having no feelings for me at all. I also burned out (turns out working 90 hour weeks with a bad diet, no exercise, no social life and little sleep is not sustainable), and I have abandonment issues that mean I stress the hell out whenever I develop feelings for someone (also the reveal that the girl was leading me on was 4 days ago). So unfortunately its hard to tell right now whether increased   and stress ect is from the Ritalin or from everything else, though based on current evidence I believe its from everything else.   The thing is, regardless, I am not noticing much from the Ritalin, increased sweating, elevated heart rate, less leg shaking, and in the beginning increased mood shortly after taking it for a short time. But im not noticing any increased focus or calm (which I was told to expect).   Ive spoken to my psychiatrist and he said it might take a bit for my brain to get used to the medication, but its tough as the ASD alters brain structure in a way that can make drugs unpredictable, plus when they first trailed me on medallion for a bit I felt literally nothing other than a decreased mood after a week of using it. I dont drink, or smoke, or do drugs, or go out and party (partly because of sensory overload issues with lots of people, bright lights and loud noises).   I was just wondering if anyone has experience in this regard? (I also inherited a high drug clearance from my father which my sister, also taking   medication, vyvance, inherited as well).

I started to just feel like I was drifting off and that I was leaving my identity with severe emotional blunting. I remember the final day I took it I would just keep looking down at my arms and thinking ""are these mine?"". I feel detached from all the people around me including my girlfriend which is whats bothering me the most.  ***I contacted my doctor about this*** and he literally was just like ""alright just stop taking them and see how you feel"".  I tried telling him about how my limbic system might be suppressed which is making me feel detached and he seemingly had no idea what I was talking about.      People say that usually the withdraw is bad if you take higher doses but I only took 10mg and I still feel like my emotions and regular human functions havent come back. its about to be the fourth day off and I barely think about eating,sex, or socializing.

3141,innowayisthisme,0.0,"Just diagnosed with ADHD at 22, unsure how to feel","I am a 22 year old female college student. I am an artist and designer, about to graduate design school this spring... well.. almost... and that is the reason I decided to speak with a psychologist.       runs in my family. My mom has it *really* badly.. like... calling me on the phone, and then proceeding to engage in a full blown conversation with the dog while I am still on the line and speaking about important things! Our house was always a mess when I was growing up. I was messy too (my room was horrendous) but my mom was a major culprit, leaving papers everywhere, never cleaning up, always a whirlwind. My dad hates mess and would come home from work only to hide in his bathroom for an hour to read a book on the toilet in peace lol.      My mom would forget doctors appointments constantly, or drive me all the way to the dentist only to be told at the desk that the appointment was actually *next* week... or even next *month.*      I was never as bad as her.. so I thought that I was fine. I thought that *she* was the textbook case of   so there was no way that I could be.     Ive always had trouble focusing, especially on things that I didnt want to do. I just assumed that I sucked because it was really hard to get me to do homework or study for the SATs. Nobody has an *easy* time doing the things that they dont like.. but I had a *really* hard time.      Then there was the hyper-focus.. a term that I have now been acquainted with which is apparently a hallmark indicator of  . I could not relate to this more. This is where my artistic talent and creativity played in. My mom is an illustrator and author as well. I could sit and draw for hours on end. If I was really interested in what I was drawing, sewing, sculpting, or generally making, I would voluntarily pull all-nighters on my own to complete my projects. Sometimes the hyper-focus was directed towards things that I wasnt interested in.. but that was rare.      Another major thing that Ive struggled with my whole life is completion of tasks and meeting deadlines. Even with projects that I was invested in, when they hyper-focus wore off I would abandon them completely. I have never been good at long-term planning, no matter how hard I try to visualize it or use strategies to manage it. Most of my hyper-focus projects are slightly unpolished, rushed at the end, or were abandoned and never continued.      I work really well under a lot of pressure. This is when my best ideas come out, this is when I can work without idling. I will pull multiple all-nighters for projects at uni, that I didnt put enough into the whole semester, and somehow come out with something acceptably complete in a matter of days, or hours.      Right now.. Im in my thesis year. We have to create a large body of work under a small number of criteria and it is basically our calling card to the industry when we graduate. Its really important. Our thesis show gets a lot of press attention and its in your own best interest to do a damn good job. Weve had the whole year of basically open studio with some soft checkpoint deadlines along the way..... and I. Have. Struggled.      Im really talented. The department head, several professors and critics, have all told me that I am one of the most talented students in the class... they just want to see me work harder. Ive had nearly a whole school year to work on this body of work, and believe me, I havent been sitting around doing nothing, but I dont have many final pieces at all. Ive done a lot of material exploration, process, research, etc... but all that matters in the end is the 6+ final pieces.      Im a motivated person, it isnt that I dont care about my work. I love what I do but I find it really really hard to work on this assignment. Ill have periods of hyper-focus and then long stretches of being physically unable to sit down at my desk.     I have tried adderall in the past, a couple times, to push for deadlines.. and it really helped me but I just thought I was being a dumb college student seeking some kind of an advantage.  I was initially intending to see a psychiatrist before my thesis year... but procrastinated on doing so.. go figure. Now, at the very end of my final semester, still having credits to fulfill after I ""graduate"" , I am finally looking into this issue.     After my first meeting with the doctor she said that she knew I had   the second I walked into the room. I managed to lose several of my personal items while I was there. My debit card and drivers license were loose in my coat lining, which was revealed when I had to pay her for the appointment. Honestly, when I went in there I felt like a bit of a fraud, a stressed college student seeking adderall... but everything came to light when she started asking me pretty simple questions, I would answer with a really prefaced, round-about sort of way, and instead of reminding me of the question when I got off track, she just let me talk.. for like 7 minutes.. and then would be like ""yes.. but I asked this""... and I was like WOW. I do this ALL the time but people either put me back on track or are just polite enough not to say anything. I was embarrassed!     She wrote me a script for adderall IR and told me to try it that day.... which I wasnt able to do because I lost my debit card and drivers license between my trip from her office to the pharmacy.. and I dont even know HOW.      I managed to pick it up eventually.. and here I am.. a low daily dose of adderall.. actually feeling rather capable of sitting and working for long periods of time, giving enough time to get in the groove to really enjoy what Im doing. I also havent been driving as aggressively as I usually do. Ive been a lot more patient with people. I notice the difference.... but I still feel like some kind of a fraud?      Im just bewildered that Ive been struggling with this for my whole life, thinking that I was just lazy or not as good as other people when in fact my struggle was very real and harder than most peoples? I was misdiagnosed with generalized   disorder when I was very young, which I was later told I ""outgrew""... which I never really had in the first place or only developed temporarily due to undiagnosed  . I was a daydreamer, not really hyperactive. I could just stare off in to space and imagine incredible things, worlds, ideas, etc. and be completely numb to the world around me. I did well in school when I *tried* but could only maintain that amount of effort for about a week at a time. A lot of things make sense now.      Im sad because I know that if this was discovered and treated earlier, I would have made *amazing* work at school.. and this is one of the top design schools in the world. I know that I have a future career but I could have had more opportunities. My thesis collection would be way further along, I would be *amazing.* Im sad that Im not truly ""graduating"" and still have so many credits due, due to dropping classes due to ""illness"" or whatever other blame I could place on something when it was really just that I always take on more than I can handle.     I dont see myself as a different person.. but Im viewing myself through a new contextual lens and its really startling to look back on my entire life, my struggles, my achievements, relationships, creativity, and actions... and now have an explanation for a lot of those things? I dont really know what to think.. or how not to feel like a fraud... somehow continue wondering if I *actually* have   or if I just suck at doing things... or if adderall is cheating because it helps me function like a responsible adult.      Im sorry that this was long.. Ive just learned a lot this week and Im sure that there are others out there who were diagnosed in their adult life... I would really love to hear about your experiences, what lead you to finally getting diagnosed, how that made you feel, how you manage it, and how youve coped since.

First of all just want to say Im so happy to have found this community online.   Now on to the main thing: Ive been experiencing strong negative (emotional) reactions towards change. It happens to me with change in plans, change in environment, whether expected or unexpected, big or small, positive or negative.  Last weekend I moved houses and moved in with my boyfriend, which I had been very excited about. Packing up &amp; sorting through logistics was stressful, but ultimately worth it. However, having spent the past week in a new house, I have found myself extremely frustrated and easily irritated at the smallest things. I dont know whats going on with my mood, but its clicked that it might be because I have a fundamental aversion towards change &amp; transition. For example, Ive always had negative emotional reactions to last-minute changes in plans with friends, even though logically I dont have a problem with the change itself (like change in venue or change in times, etc).  Ive tried researching the correlation between adult   and struggling to adjust to change... but nothing conclusive comes up. Please share any similar experiences youve had so I can feel not-crazy, as well as your personal coping mechanisms, if any.

3145,Zadcost77,0.0,"Once daily extended release meds, or twice daily instant release meds?","**Background Info** Ive been taking Vyvanse for about 4 months now and Im currently on 50mg daily taken when I wake up (around 10:00am). Ive been experiencing a few issues with it recently however and am going to go to my doctor tomorrow to try and switch to something else. Ive been researching and Im wondering weather I should stick to once daily extended release medications, or try two instant release doses at two different times a day.  Personally, Ive only ever been on Vyvanse because I was only diagnosed 4 months ago and its all Ive taken. However, Vyvanse seems to make me very irritable about 5 hours after dosing. The comedown also seems to be more drawn out but almost torturous for me. Those two reasons are the reason I want to switch to something different.  *My research Ive gathered &amp; my own personal experience is as follows:*  **Instant Release:** * About 15-45 minutes time to take effect * Lasts shorter (4-6 hours on average) * Come-downs are harder * Supposidley higher amounts of focus while in effect  **Extended Release:** * Longer Time to Take effect (45-90 minutes) * Lasts Longer (8-12 hours) * Comedown not as pronounced or hard * Less amounts of focus in exchange for longer lasting  Weighing out the differences between all the different meds is really hard though so if any of you have experience with any of them Id appreciate your input :)  **Ive narrowed it down to a few that I think look promising, however there may be others I havent considered, if you know of any Id love to hear from you. The ones Ive found are:** * Adderall XR - Taken once in the morning, possibly with an Adderall IR or equivalent IR booster later in the day * Adderall IR - Taken twice daily * Dexedrine - Taken once daily, possibly with an Adderall IR or equivalent IR booster later in the day * Amfexa - Taken once daily, possibly with an Adderall IR or equivalent IR booster later in the day",1553820607,1553820608,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b6qvin/once_daily_extended_release_meds_or_twice_daily/,False,False,1.0
3146,LyphBB,0.0,Early stages of romance between an ADD (treated) and an ADHD (untreated),"Hi there!   This turned into a LONG post so the TL:DR- I am falling for someone who isn’t great at texting me often when super busy. Not upset about the frequency of replies but need help on regulating the emotions  that come with developing a crush. I don’t like it!  —— Post: (oh, obligatory, I’m on mobile, forgive my formatting if it sucks. )  First time in a long time I decided to pursue a romantic interest and it turns out we share our ADD/  mindset, maybe it adds to how we clicked instantly. Biggest difference is I’m medicated (full time college student and I work) and he is unmedicated due to childhood side effects (works every single day, at least 10 hours a day). I’m late 20s, he’s early 30s. Only 3 or 4 years apart.   While we both will go through sprints of getting so busy that we don’t text each other, he has these sprints way more often than I do. I noticed a pattern that if I get a text it’ll be between 8:00pm and 9:00pm. When we text, we can text for hours. Time flies by just like in person. He’s under extra stress so midday texts have dwindled.   While I’m medicated and bored or in between tasks or something random I want to share happens, I really want to text. If I’m unmedicated, I am so wrapped up in my distractions that it doesn’t come up. However, I’m almost always medicated during the week. (Get to actually see him on the weekends so no problem 2 days out of the week.)  I don’t want to bombard him with text messages, I know I am less likely to respond to a million text messages. Gotta love that avoidance. Also, if there is a string of text or a change in topic, it’ll get missed and only the most recent stuff will register.   Ultimately I want a text message from me to be a positive response, not a “ugh, not another text!” . I’m trying only 1 random text  and just reply when I get a text.   I’m not upset or offended from a lack of reply, I get it, but how in the world do I get my mind off of this guy since I’m falling into this “crush” sensation that I have not felt in a looooong time?  I was legitimately sad when I didn’t get a text in 3 days and I was instantly overwhelmed with happiness when I got a random “how’re you?”. I had my leveled, constant state of calm finally mastered until this. Of course, no poker face, nothing is more annoying than “why do you seem down?”, I don’t think I’m THAT down to display it. “Because I didn’t get a text” is just a silly reason.   Any suggestions for remaining my cool and not succumbing to this “crush”?  I haven’t dated in so long that I don’t remember how I dealt with it in the past.

At the time I was on the brink of being fired from my job - only hung on to my position by thread due to a legal technicality.  I wouldnt have wanted to hire me - I was unproductive, disorganised, terrible memory, low energy. Basically I had tried to get a job in Government because I new it was harder to fire people from Government and Id been fired/let go of/contract not renewed so. many. times.

It also makes me enjoy doing them more &amp; makes me feel much better about how I spend my time in general.

However, once I come down from my the medication, &amp; especially if I forget to take it the next day, I feel like I sort of undergo the opposite effect of it; I get this crashed feeling &amp; sometimes end up being/feeling sluggish, irresponsible, &amp; slovenly (seemingly more so than I normally am if I dont take medication at all). This effect can compound into me replacing more &amp; more good habits with bad ones, &amp; I want to be able to avoid/mitigate/manage it better since it seems to largely determine what kinds of things I end up doing with most of my time.  (If it matters: Im on Vyvanse now, &amp; switching over to Adderall soon. I dont expect any major differences, as Ive taken Adderall before to very similar effect.)  I already have a daily schedule for myself to make routines out of doing basic responsibilities like taking my meds, but when I get knocked out of sync I will often take a long time to get back on track &amp; I end up losing a lot of time &amp; energy to being unfocused &amp; distracted from my goals.

So let me give a setting so I can explain myself, I have a long distance girlfriend thats I started dating at the end of highschool for about 9 months she went to college 4 hours away and Im at home I work 50-57 hours work weeks and goto school part time, important because I don’t have much time. Most of my friends are very far away too so I don’t get to see anyone often at all chances are if my girlfriend is home so are my friends. I have my bros and then I have 3 other friends that are girls that I have been friends with since the beginning of highschool. She gets upset with me if I hangout with them and don’t tell her. I told her that I don’t even think about it really because Im so excited to see my friends. And she said if I cared about her she would tell me. I said I don’t want to promise that I would tell her because I know I would forget sometimes and would be scared of the backlash from her if I told her afterward. She didn’t understand and we got pretty into it. She says she trusts me but this makes me not believe her. She knows I have   and has witnessed me lose my keys wallet and other small things numerous times, one time I set my keys down in a target and walked out of the store before realizing I didn’t have my keys. Anyways again she knows I struggle with very small things so remembering to text her can be pretty hard because I could remember then all of a sudden im distracted and forget about it and go about my day.

3166,notjonnny,0.0,Metabolism and Vyvanse: Why did my meds completely change the way they affect me?,"New to vyvanse, first time on stimulant medications. Having really really really strange effects after a couple weeks. Wondering if anyone has had the same experience and if it has something with the way my body/metabolism processes this prodrug. Couldnt find anything similar to this on reddit so decided to make my own post. Any help is appreciated!  So Im new here in the adderall/  subreddits. Ive been taking my prescribed vyvanse for the past 3 weeks give or take(this is my first time on stimulant   meds). I started on a 30mg dose in the morning and that did work for the first couple days. I had such a good amount of focus and energy, and a little push of motivation to get tasks and school work done that before seemed like a huge struggle. The meds seemed to last about 8 hours, and then slowly taper off. Some mild come down side-effects, but nothing terrible or out of the ordinary for this medication. After that though, the next few days the beneficial effects seemed to completely subside and I was left with maybe 4 hours of slightly effective duration leading to it wearing off and making me feel completely numb and extremely exhausted to the point I needed to nap. After this discussing this with my psychiatrist, we decided to increase my dose to 50mg, which seemed like it would be a much better fit. The first few days of taking the new dose it seemed like this was going to be the right dose for me. I felt clear-headed, able to focus, and a good amount of motivation. However, about 4 days later the same thing as before happened. I would take the vyvanse in the morning and it would work for maybe 4-5 hours before completely dropping off.  Yesterday, I took my vyvanse in the morning again before school, and right at 1:30, about 4 hours and 30 minutes after taking my medication, I just felt this strong switch where it seemed like the medication turned off completely without gradually slowing down and left me feeling like a zombie. I felt completely out of it and just like I wasnt really present. I didnt necessarily feel depressed or that anxious. Just super super out of it and like my mind had turned off everything except a slight ability to focus on something. I found myself completely zoned into my thoughts, forgetting everything else going on around me. My friends said my eyes looked really glossy and I looked a little off too. I immediately went home and slept the rest of the day. I would wake up periodically and eat a ton of food and then go back to sleep. The next morning I woke feeling super super groggy and out of it still, but not like I had the day before. I thought that weird feeling like a zombie thing was just a weird reaction for that day, so I took it again. Essentially the same thing happened just in a slightly less strong way. Around 4-5 hours after taking it, I noticed it just completely wearing off. I was able to function for another hour but then had to to take about an hour nap. I woke feeling a little better and was able to finish out my day. TO clarify, the vyvanse was really helping with   the first couple days of each dose, and even when it seemed less effective and not lasting long it still seemed to help a bit, but barely.  Luckily I was able to pick up my script for dextroamphetamine (generic Teva/Barr) today because I already was talking to my psych about the duration of effectiveness problem. So I will be starting 10mg dex 2-3 times a day tomorrow.   I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing problems similar to this on vyvanse? It is advertised as a med that will get you coverage lasting from 10-12 hours on the website, but I was getting at most 5. Also, I looked for posts of people having the same sort of weird crash effect I was getting, but couldnt find any. Has anyone else had problems like this with vyvanse? it seems everyone has a good experience on it except me.  And before you ask, I eat a good breakfast after I take my medication, and drink a ton of water all day, as well as eat small things during the day, so I dont think thats the problem.  Since vyvanse is a prodrug, could the reason it only works for 4-5 hours then completely stops and makes me want to sleep be because of my metabolism? Could it have worked at first because my body/metabolism wasnt used to it yet. I know that vyvanse is lysdexamfetamine, meaning the lysine molecule has to be cleaved off once digested before it becomes active. Could my body/metabolism be responding different to it, and that is why its giving me these really strange side effects?   I start dex 10mg ir 2-3 a day tomorrow so helpfully that is the change I need.   Just looking to see if anyone has had this experience on vyvanse and if anyone knows why this happens. Also, anyone who has had similar experiences to vyvanse, what med did you find that worked best for you?  Any feedback and experience is appreciated, as I am new to all of this and couldnt really find anything specific like this on either the adderall or   subreddits.

3169,wtfie,0.0,Adjusting goals to be realistic instead of idealistic,"So I finally actually took the advice I see everywhere, and broke down a task into pieces and estimated how much time itll take (I havent yet tested my time estimates).  I previously thought I should be able to call 8-10 clients in an hour, if none of them answer. Seems reasonable, right? 6 minutes per client seems like plenty to dial, leave a voicemail, and shoot off a quick email.  But since Id rather procrastinate today, I went back and thought about what *calling a client* actually means.  It means I have to look thru the previous notes. Doubly so if its a new-to-me client. So thats AT LEAST 5 mins.  Then I have to dial the phone and wait for it to ring, get thru the voicemail intro, and leave ~1 minute message. Figure thats at least 3-5 minutes.  Then I have to compose a follow up email, read it ten times before I send it. Thats another 5 minutes, being generous.  And then I have to put the notes into the system and make sure everything is set up well to get caught in my filters so no one falls thru the cracks. Figure thats another 5 mins.  That means 1 client phone call could take AT A MINIMUM 20 minutes!! And thats only if they dont answer or theres nothing weird and unusual!   I was getting upset at myself because I couldnt seem to get thru 10 dials in an hour, and so I gradually stopped doing it, because failure.  UHM DUH NO WONDER! I can maybe reach out to 3 clients in an hour, tops. Not 10!   I would have been frustrated before that it takes 20 minutes and assuming that Im just slow or doing something wrong. But breaking it down says that 20 minutes is actually quick! And over time, I hope I can tighten things up, but Im not going to beat myself up anymore for not reaching goals that were never really reachable in the first place.  MIND.

I have a few different problems. Sometimes I just dont see the emails, Ill be home or driving or doing something else my phone notifications fill up and I dont see it for a day or longer.

But not only did my meds NOT help my brain but they also had MORE side effects; dry mouth, short temper, headaches. And I was constantly overloaded with sounds and visuals. I had to leave three classes today to go sit in the washroom and ride out the anger or   attacks. Like any sound/sight/smell just brings out this wave of fear/stress/anger.

3173,gttc1991,0.0,Questions about Adderall vs Vyvanse.,"Hey guys!   I have a few questions regarding Adderall and Vyvanse. I know the differences between the two chemically and action related, I think I’m looking for some input from those who’ve been on both.   I was recently diagnosed with inattentive   about 4 months ago. I am currently in 15mg adderall IR twice daily. I have noticed a few things about how it effects me. It’s also worth mentioning that I am notoriously bad at gauging the emotions of others, and even worse at gauging my own. If you were to ask me how I’m feeling at any given moment if I’m not either angry or happy at that time my answer will be “I have no idea.” So basically I don’t know how I feel at any given time. It makes me worry that I might also have high functioning autism but that’s beside the point.   What I’ve noticed with the adderall is that the first month or so it was working great. I was finally able to focus, sit still at work, and my favorite benefit was that my patience for other people was 100x better. For a month or so now my patience has dwindled down to just above baseline levels which is still not good. When I was at work and started to feel like people were starting to make pissy I thought it was my medication wearing off. Just yesterday I realized that even though I was pissy I still had focus and was able to sit at my desk without taking numerous fake bathroom trips just to get up. So I’m thinking now that the adderall is making me moody and irritable, which sucks because those first months I was so patient and it was a great feeling.   The reason I’m asking about vyvanse is that my girlfriend is on vyvanse and she gave me one of her pills a few days ago so see how it was. It worked almost like my adderall had in the first months. Has anybody else been on adderall and stared getting moody on it a few months in and then switched to vyvanse for one reason or another?   I spoke to my doctor about this last month, how the adderall wasn’t covering my entire shift at work. I was thinking this because of the irritability, but as stated I realized I still had the focus yesterday. When I told him he bumped me up from 10mg x2 to 15mg x2 and said if it’s still not covering me that we will try Ritalin type meds next. I’m a bit worried about Ritalin because I’ve read a few studies that suggest that it can negatively effect those receptors in the brain. My girlfriends psych didn’t want her on those for that reason.   ",1553809928,1553811028,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b6ovmc/questions_about_adderall_vs_vyvanse/,False,False,1.0

Theyve supported I properly schedule my medication and suggested invaluable structure adjustments.  They generally are super cool about describing experiences and how to do A,B,C etc that helped/help them.   These are Cliffs Notes versions of intense discussions that have been happening for awhile now, and culminating in better understandings of how to reply-  Them: That level of reactivity is unacceptable Me: Ok, cool - working on it thanks for telling me  T: You cant just interrupt and derail conversations  Me: Ok, cool - I can work on that, thats a huge faux pas in any situation T: Google questions before asking them. Me: Aight - got it, I know that Ive had this issue before and I can do it again!  Then watching the way that some of their interactions pan out exhibiting the same hallmarks of what Im being chastised for - really hurts. No one is perfect. Neuro- and non-typicals alike. Demonizing each other helps no one.  Im reestablishing mental health care, as my previous therapist was not particularly structured (because also  ) and while them understanding it helped, the lack of structure did not.  Feeling like Im upright then losing the rug over and over in these interactions is really difficult. I choose to continue interacting with them because the way theyve built such a great system for themselves and taught others is really admirable and inspiring.

3208,unexistingusername,0.0,I finally read about ADHD/ADD and it made me cry because I identified with a lot of the symptoms,"Iso sorry about the rant, I just discovered I might have some sort of ADD and I wrote down a bit (or maybe a lot!) about myself, so you really dont have to read it if you are not interested :)     Okay. I just had a thought a few hours ago (yes, even though I could have done the research right away, I put it off, even though I was excited to see what I would find, but go figure). Anyway, I had this crazy thought that I might, *maybe*, have a mild case of  /ADD. I didnt really know much about the condition, I guess I was familiar with the stereotypes. I am a girl btw, and I have always been very well-behaved, never caused trouble and I can be shy/anxious sometimes. I have always had excellent grades, Im never late and I can be a big perfectionist sometimes. So, obviously, it was ridiculous to even think I could have ADD. Now, Im not that sure anymore. I actually started crying while reading some peoples descriptions. These last few months, my life has been a *mess*. I stopped going to class, and, quite literally out of nowhere realized that biology is not what I want to do. So, I basically wasted three semesters (or more like four). As I said, I have always been an excellent student and this is not something I could ever have imagined myself doing. I actually used to make fun of people who dropped out and didnt seem to know what they wanted.  I dont even know how to organize my thoughts right now, Im really sorry for writing this in such a messy way.  So these last few months, I got pretty depressed (I guess that would describe it best). I had been ignoring so many things in my life since a very young age, probably because it was the only way to cope with everything. So once I realized that, everything I was holding back just exploded. I have always had severe   (and somehow managed to ignore it), like, I hated speaking in front of the class, and seemed to overthink everything *way* too much. That is definitely not normal, but I thought it was my fault and always tried to act like everything was fine. I tend to sweat a lot, so when Im in an uncomfortable situation its just awful, and then I try to hide it even more, but it makes me even more anxious, and it just turns into this vicious circle. That was a little digression, sorry. What I wanted this to come down to was that I am really not doing great these days, I have isolated myself and go out only if I really need to, I dont really have any friends where I live, and I am left with the internet and my crazy brain that constantly needs to be entertained. And I get bored super easily. I find it very hard to just do nothing. When I think about it, these last few years, I even had a lot of trouble sitting still in class and would need to move every 30 seconds. I would often literally lie down in my chair with my legs outstretched only to feel the urge to sit back up moments later, and no one else really seemed to need to do that. *And*, I have *always* done my homework at the last minute, and I always managed to pull it off, even in college. I was not always proud of it, but I was never able to break that habit, no matter how hard I tried. Procrastination almost rhymes with me. I always put off things Im not hyped about. For instance, as I spend my days at home, I am told to do some chores. And guess what! Everything gets done, but in the evening, when I really have no choice. And I hate doing stuff that is not entertaining, so I try to compensate by constantly listening to music, for instance. Just to occupy my mind.  I have also a pretty bad case of compulsive skin picking disorder (also known as dermatillomania). Its a form of OCD that consists in picking the skin uncontrollably, sometimes for several hours in a row (okay, that was actually what I was doing earlier instead of writing this). It is extremely frustrating to live with because my skin is full of scabs and scars and its just awful, which adds a lot to my insecurities. Thats an activity that actually feels good while Im doing it, and thats why its often how I procrastinate. I actually pity myself.  (This parts is pretty useless but Ill leave it now that its written) I have also lived in several different countries and therefore speak three languages fluently, and I learned another one quite well. I use my mother tongue at home, and its not the language of the country Ive been living in for the past 12 years (Im 20). I rarely have the opportunity to speak English but as you can see I hang out on the internet a lot and I definitely use the language on a daily basis. I have been hating the country Im living in since the start, for some reason. I just dont identify with it and it doesnt make things easier.  Lately, Ive been trying to think of something I could do with my life, but everything seems just so scary. I feel like I will fail at everything I try to do. I never feel good enough even though I do think that I have qualities and Im not stupid. Its probably because I overthink too much. I just get over new things very quickly, it feels like nothing will ever be able to hold my attention for long enough for me to want to study it or to be able to make it a job. And everything feels just way too complicated, with too many details, no matter the field. I mean, even working as a salesperson seems so stressful and complicated to me. At this point, I literally dont know what to do with myself.  Now that I discovered I *might* have some sort of ADD, I am honestly so relieved. I know its bad to self-diagnose things like that, and Im not going to take everything I read as granted, but I truly do think its a *possibility*. I will talk to a professional about it and hopefully someone will be able to help me at least a little...

Last time I talked with her was back in October when she basically implied that she doesnt think I can handle this job and maybe I should demote myself to a sales assistant. I cried in the bathroom and in my car for a few hours after and have basically avoided her ever since. Im an independent contractor so its not like she can fire me or force me to do anything, but I definitely didnt get looked at seriously for any important opportunities. I had just quit an alcohol addiction a couple weeks prior to that, so things were looking really terrible at that point (I didnt share that bit with her). It was a tipping point for sure.   And, after months of my procrastination not getting significantly better despite all my efforts and starting to recognize how horrible I am at prioritizing, I started digging deeper and saw   as a possibility and everything clicked. Im still waiting on a diagnostic appt in April and been keeping to myself lately (20 MORE DAYS TO JUST THE FIRST MEETING AUGH).  She mentioned that shed like to talk to me about giving me some clients last week. Cue me shitting myself, because I know theres no way I can get away from the inevitable talk about what Im doing and my goals and all that bs, but I do want/need the clients. Ive been doing much better than last year, but definitely not thriving. The wheels are spinning now but Im not getting very far.  I had planned to not say anything about my   suspicion. But, my damn oversharing mouth, I said that I knew I was underperforming and I was bringing in some professionals to help me figure it out, as an explanation. She kind of asked what specific issues I was trying to work on and out it came: I suspect I have  , its affecting literally everything, and I have an appointment in April to confirm or deny it.  To my surprise...she nodded knowingly and asked if Id ever been tested before. I said no, but that I was smart enough in school to procrastinate and do everything last minute and still get good grades, and the external deadlines kept me on track, which is why I was falling flat on my face now trying to self-motivate. She assumed the same thing I did, that teachers werent paying close attention to me because I was labeled as gifted very early on and would have my nose in a book, they had other things to worry about, which is why it never became apparent until now, when all the external consequences are largely absent. She was so understanding that I wonder if she didnt have a similar experience herself or with her kids or with other reps.  And then she told me some about the clients that she wants to give me, really it would be me in charge of a small plan at a school. Its a great opportunity for me, but it requires consistent follow up to keep the client happy. She said that the person who is in charge of it now (who just had a kid) was a little wary about giving it to me of all people, but my boss thought it would be a good fit and its not too far out of my way from my regular out of town territory. Quite frankly, I think this responsibility will provide some of the external consequences I so desperately need. And Im really determined to not fuck this up. We talked about a couple other things, which the agreement was that we will wait to see about the   thing before making any more changes, and Ill be meeting with her weekly starting in a few weeks (fuck).

So we decided that I would go on Vyvanse for the month, to break the tolerance, as it had worked in the past.  The month on Vyvanse was unpleasant to say the least. I knew it would be, I prepared for it, but still. I was a draining month.   Yesterday, exactly one month to the day, I went to see my doctor. We discussed how the month had been on Vyvanse. I also told him that the one of the pharmacist at the pharmacy I go to scared me a little when she told me that it was possible that Concerta would never work for me again. My doctor really wasnt pleased with her.   Still, Id told him Id done my researched, and that there were solutions I wanted to explore if Concerta didnt work. He agreed with my solutions and even gave me the choice to go on that medication right away if I wanted too. Since that medication wouldnt have been covered by my provincial insurance (and it would take 1-2 months of hoops jumping to get it approved), we both decided that Concerta was my best bet.     So, cue to this morning, where I took  36mg of Concerta, the first step in working my way up to my usual 63mg dosage.  Well, Itd not working, at all. My brain either is chasing imaginary squirrels and unicorns or the hamster is running a non-stop sprint in its wheel. Any way you chose to look at it, theres a circus going on up there and those monkeys appear to be mine. Im tired as hell, and I could eat the whole content of the fridge and I could just sleep the day away.  Honestly, Im scared. Im scared its not going to work for me anymore. Im scared Ill never find another medication that works as well as Concerta has for me.      The worst part is, I know 36mg is way too low a dose for me. I know Im barely suppose to feel its effect. I know its too early to tell, that it might just be because Im scared it wont work any more. I know all that. Rationally.   But it would appear that today, I cannot regulate my emotions.

3228,huskyandthehound,0.0,ADHD-friendly tools for Mac-based productivity - aka delaying the inevitable attention derail,"**Generally helpful utilities**  I am a 29 year old, a graphic designer/photographer/videographer, and I work on a Mac for most of the workday (unless I am shooting photo/video or traveling). A few years out of college (and almost exactly a year ago) I was diagnosed with Adult   and began meds (Adderall XR).   The meds helped immensely (and so did some books/blogs/videsos) but I still found it imperative to take a variety of measures to be productive at work. In college, I had let my intelligence make up for my procrastination. Tbh, I would be in a world of hurt had I not always been ""gifted"" and grown up in circumstances that forced me to do well in school.  The job I am at now (the one from above) is not the job I had when I finally sought a diagnosis.  I was working in a  corporate communication role and this was where I had to develop my coping skills and find tools to help survive...especially as an  -er working under an obsessively micromanaging (and very non   friendly) manager.  Hopefully this small list of things I use can help someone else too...especially because I ""wasted"" too much time writing this post instead of editing photos and working on an email template.....oh  ...     **The good stuff -**  * **App/Website Distractions** \- ability to block access to apps or websites or servers etc and not let you regain access until the timer or schedule (that you have set) allows it. Great to prevent my mind from wandering onto websites / forums / social media while I am working.    * [**SelfControl**](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) **-** Original app I used in college. Pretty basic and (to my knowledge) does not block apps, just websites.    * [**Freedom**](https://freedom.to/) **-** Really great (or used to be) app for blocking websites AND apps on both the iPhone and Mac. Due to recent (as of last year) changes Apple made to rules about app behavior after they introduced their screen time features, I do not think they can block apps from connecting like they used to. I still use this everyday on my mac and often on my phone (as i purchased it before the new stipulations had been put into place).    * [**Focus**](https://heyfocus.com/) **-**  Just found out about this one and I think I am going to try it. It seems to be very highly rated. Looks to block any websites or apps that you want to block with a nice UI.     * **Enhancing focus -**     * [**HazeOver**](https://hazeover.com/) **-** Darkens/Dims any of your windows that are not being use by the app you are currently working in. I love this app because I work on a nearly 40 inch 4k screen and not only is it bright for editing, I generally have a number of windows open at once (lets not talk about how many browser tabs my computer is cursing at me for having open) and this helps me focus on what I need to be working on at that current time.    * [**Magnet**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) **-** Allows me to manage the position and size of my windows more efficiently and effectively. Helps with the overwhelming feeling I can get when having to deal with a lot of windows or toolbars or export windows etc.     * **Generally helpful utilities**    * [**Alfred**](https://www.alfredapp.com/) \- I am notorious for saving files in random places and sometimes not naming them ideally....you know...""ForReview\_videoexport\_final\_v3\_June18.mp4"" or something stupid like that....I know I need to fix my habits...  Alfred makes it a whole lot easier to find files, open things, launch things, perform actions and do a lot of stuff on the mac and it is WAY better than spotlight.    * [**Things 3**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904280696?mt=12) (or Todoist if that is your style) - Yeah, yeah, I know, it costs 50 effing bucks for Things 3 on the mac. It is worth it. It is much easier for me to deal with tasks during the day using the desktop app. I love the keybaord shortcut integration to add content from the app I have open as a new task and overall it is designed well. Now....why cant we have collaboration with other Things 3 users......ugh    * [**Anylist**](https://www.anylist.com/mac) \- I freaking love AnyList. I have used it for years. Set my wife and I up on it...we use it exclusively for shopping/grocery lists (and we set it up as the default shopping list on Alexa). Nice to be able to access and manage it from the Mac.    * I know there are others I am forgetting (please...feel free to comment with your favorites).

Do you (or any friends you have) enjoy it? What are some qualities one MUST have?  To give a little background, my undergraduate degree is in theatrical studies. After I graduated, I was sort of lost for a while, went through a bad breakup, and ended up taking a basic job while helping out my parents (one of them has a deteriorating condition) and twiddling my thumbs. Ive always, and will always be interested in the arts but the other side of me has always been fascinating with medicine. I served on a first aid squad during my teen years and loved it. As a result, Ive recently been thinking of different careers to give me some structure, pay the bills, but also will touch upon my life experiences.  About a week ago, someone suggested occupational therapy to me and after doing a little bit of reading, it seemed like an exciting prospect. I have a habit though of getting really exciting about something, only to hit a roadblock and then get completely derailed. So when I wasnt feeling demotivated by the work and additional schooling that might be involved, my curiosity really began to peak.

Ill start with the tl;dr  **tl;dr: a good friend of mine is suffering with what MUST be   but is struggling to find a way to get diagnosed, how, in the UK, can one get diagnosed without it taking an aeon?**     The too-long version is as follows: my friend has all the hallmarks of   but some of the hyperactive symptoms have been masked (particularly in their youth) by certain specific elements of their upbringing. It has caused (or, at least contributed to) some great difficulties, particularly in higher education and things like job applications. They have fully diagnosed and well-medicated depression and some   that doesnt seem to be its own thing so much as a textbook offshoot of some of the depressive symptoms. Im not asking for a diagnosis or any detailed response to this, it just seems that there may potentially be roadblocks with comorbidity/concurrence/whatever the right word is that someone out there may have advice for.  They have already experienced roadblocks in applying for funding to go private (tbh it seems like the private option was likely at least partially a rip-off anyway) and the local wellbeing system has failed them in a few key ways that makes them fairly unwilling to go back to them. At the very least, going back to them would be slow, painful, generalised and, worst-case scenario, no help at all. Can anyone recommend a way for someone to get a referral to someone useful and get toward the right treatment?     If anyone has any helpful advice at all beyond ""go to the GP"" (which is already the next step) wed be immensely grateful. Even what to say when at the appointment.

For example, a few of the things that I do around this are:  * Make lunch in the morning (even though I could just eat at home as I dont start work until 1pm) - if I do this Im far more likely to make healthy choices instead of just grabbing McDonalds on the way to work, or a bag of chips * The alarm across the room idea, but I intensify it with a sunrise clock so that its even less likely for me to really be able to go back to sleep * Making a strict grocery shopping list before I go to the store - far less likely to have impulse purchases! (plus, I do grocery shopping for people sometimes through shipt, so I treat my own grocery list like that) * All my evening routine things are in one place so that if I remember to do the routine at all, Im far more likely to not forget a step!

At that moment, it crossed my mind that I overshared. But I was like, ah fuck it, I am who I am.  Double surprise; she said “  in this industry is probably a good thing”.

When I was maybe my parents had me tested, and the results were inconclusive, but since I was able to perform well enough in school at the time they didnt seek further treatment.  My attention span seemed to decline since then but I was still able to pass school with As and Bs but had severe motivational difficulties doing anything beyond the bare minimum of schoolwork.  At about age 16 I ended up getting into drugs which is in a large part to blame for sabotaging the next ten years of my life.  During my sophomore year I tried adderall recreationally and was completely blown away by what it did to my brain.  It was like a missing piece of brain got stuck into place and suddenly I could think linearly and get shit done.  I never sought out a prescription and rarely ever got it though because I was having problems with other drugs and was still able to pass school.  Fast forward through graduation and into college my   symptoms ran up against reality after a series of false starts and failures and dropped out of college three times and ended up a quasi-drug addict who had to go to rehab for opiods and general drug abuse.  I fixed my addiction and dont do anything now but caffeine and a beer or two in the evenings to relax.  Im 30 years old now with a job, child, and a last chance to get my shit together and go back to school but with my   symptoms worse than ever I fear Im being set up for failure if I try to take on school.  Also Im terrible at my job (barista) and in fear of getting fired mostly due to my inability to organize my thoughts well enough to perform.  This is basically my last chance to take control of my brain and life before my folks chuck me out with a child.  After all that being said could anyone here with knowledge of the medical industrial complex tell me how difficult would it be for me to obtain a script for adderall or vyvanse with my past addiction issues?  Will a Dr actually look through my records?  I also got a diagnosis and script for adderall when I was about 21 but never filled it because I had just dropped out of school.

3272,CardboardHeatshield,0.0,How do you organize all of your work?,"So I started a new job about a year ago and was like ""Im going to make a folder for everything important, even if it only gets a few documents in it.""  Ive been loosely sticking to this rule and its been a great start.   However, fast forward a year, and I now have a drawer full of scrambled folders and it takes time and effort to find anything, so I usually just wind up printing off another copy anyhow.  I just cleaned my desk and found literally three different copies of the same brochure in three different places on my desk.  I literally already had it on my desk, and printed another one because Id rather hit print and walk to the copier than be bothered to sift through my stuff and find it. Twice.    Its like that with notebooks too.  I keep a notebook. I write things down in my notebook.  I write a *lot* of valuable information in my notebook.  And then I never go back to read my notebooks because theyre a garbled mess.  One page is a to-do list from 7 months ago, the next is garbled meeting notes from the next day, the next is something that I read in a book that I thought was important enough to write down, the next is half a table I started before a meeting and them meeting notes in the unfinished table space.  Its the same with computer files at work.  I have a folder on the drive.  It has many subfolders.  I save everything.  But when I go back in 6 months to find something, I notice that there are like three different subfolders it could be in, and I spend 10 minutes looking for it.  And then I found out I had saved it into my ""Soup Kitchen"" folder, which is where all of the homeless documents hang out, because I wasnt *quite* finished with it.    Ill try to organize stuff but in three weeks Ill think of a better way to organize all my stuff and start doing it that way.    About the only consistently organized thing in my life is the folder full of my wet signatures in my desk.  Everything I sign gets scanned and then the original goes directly into that folder. These are important because I feel directly responsible for anything that has my ink signature on it, and feel a strong need to keep track of those things.   TL;DR:  My work is a mess and I cant find anything because I dont have a good organization system that I stick to.  How do you do it?

So, a big part of my life I have been curious about things related to what you may call ""social skills"".  I read body language pretty well and understand peoples wants and needs. When I was a kid I had a very hard time fitting in and I really improved since being a teenager.  Because I am big on cinema and books I learned a lot of it from, well, cinema and books.     The most slippery quality a person can posses, it seems to me, is charisma. Some people defined it but its still really hard to define and for me really hard to understand. But I know that a lot of it comes from something I call ""engagement"" or more accurately, being engaged. Being in the moment, being sharp, seeing and reacting.  Theres also voice. And theres also persistence. Meaning something like ""dont break character"". When people see you behaving different than you usually are or being in your own world and not theirs even one time they lose some of their definition for your charisma, which is in essence the charisma itself.     Now I dont know if a persons voice has much to do with  , but I think both engagement and persistence have a lot to do with it.     I would love to hear your thoughts and experience regarding this, but my main question is - do you think   hinders charisma?

Sometimes its just clumsiness, but often its just not thinking something through or really taking the time to figure something out before doing it. Far too often, this ends up with me breaking or damaging things, or messing things up that either I or my fiance (or coworkers) then have to clean up/fix.   I hate feeling stupid. It is the worst feeling in the world. And because of that, I often end up taking it personally and feeling like Im being called stupid when my fiance shows me something I did the wrong way. But my rational self knows he isnt calling me stupid and that he doesnt think Im stupid. He just needs to show me what I did wrong and how to do it correctly for next time so the same thing doesnt happen again.   I imagine this is super frustrating for him but he doesnt tell me so. Hes extremely handy and he just fixes the problem and shows me how to do better. I appreciate that and he deserves to have me respond with gratitude, not frustration or offense. But in the moment when I feel stupid, I cant seem to think beyond that. I always react with frustration and then a few minutes later when Ive had time to calm down and think, I go back and say sorry and thank him for fixing it and showing me how to do whatever it was correctly.   It hasnt been an issue yet, because he is so patient, but I worry that if I dont get this emotional response under control it will become an issue over time.

How do you self-motivate?  For example, Im supposed to call most of my clients every quarter. Theres even an hour in my schedule each week to reach out to some of them. But my mind knows that theres no real consequences if I dont do it. So I push it off to next week, because theres much more urgent stuff to do right now! And next week. And next week. Now were in week 13 and I have done...drumroll please...0 contacts for quarterlies. Part of the hesitation is organizing (scary) which clients go into which week, but thats a different issue.  I know, rationally, that I shouldnt do this. If I reach my clients quarterly, I can get increases sales, more appointments, more referrals, they actually remember my name and who I am, etc. Harping on the benefits doesnt do anything for me because its not an immediate reward, and some calls *arent* going to be rewarding. And its not like my managers will care if its not done, its my practice/business, I can run it however I like. So I put it off for things that do have more immediate rewards/consequences, and/or more fun stuff cause by the end of the day Im just so exhausted that I say ""fuck it"" and dont do it.  I am stagnating. There are tons of ""maintenance"" things that I should be doing, but I dont. I try putting artificial deadlines on it, but the brain knows that they arent real, theres not any true immediate consequences, and I opt for other stuff.

3281,austinography,0.0,"My ADHD journey. Finally being treated, more terrified than ever.","So, I will preface this by saying that I, like many with this disorder, went through the majority of my life unaware that I had a medical disorder of any kind.  I just sort of thought this was how life was, and it was tough.  I didnt present with hyperactivity as a child, but my older brother did.  So, while he got tested and for a time treated for  , I was never given a second thought.  I struggled my way through school with all the common issues that Im sure many of you sympathize with.  Never did my homework, but aced the tests, so I got by.  Bounced around majors in college and missed lots of class, wrote papers at the last possible moment, and somehow BSd my way to a degree.   As an adult, in my professional life, I have been a job hopper.  I average about 2-3 years before I absorb all there is to absorb about what I find interesting in the position and then get completely uninterested.  In my home life, I have always struggled to be a good spouse when it comes to co-managing schedules and completing household chores.  Its not that I dont know those things need to be done and how to do them.  I just dont do them.  There was never any reason behind it, and it really made me feel bad that I was letting my family down.  About a year ago, I laid out a lot of my symptoms about the lack of focus, trouble at home, etc. to a new PCP.  His diagnosis at the time was mild depression or seasonal effective disorder, and he prescribed me Lexapro.  Now, I absolutely hated how that made me feel.  It was like it took the brain fog and lack of focus to a whole new level.  I felt like a zombie and I stopped taking it.  Cut to this year, a month ago actually, and I am seeing a new PCP.  I law out my symptoms to him and let him know about the LexaFail.  And I basically say ""Am I just a stressed out 35 y/o man with a full time job and 3 kids and this is just how I should feel?"".  And he said ""No, this is not normal.""  And let me tell you, it was kind of great just to get some validation.  He suggested the possibility of   which I had honestly never considered and didnt even know affected adults.   After a psychologist referral, the diagnosis was confirmed and I started on 20mg daily Adderall last week.  While its comforting to finally know what is going on with me and have a plan in place to confront it, its also a bit overwhelming.  The medication has been great so far.  Like many others have described, it was very much like putting on glasses.  I function like I should without even having to dedicate any conscious thought to it.  While I am now more optimistic about the future, I am also uncertain b/c I dont want to always be reliant on these meds.  The other part of all of this that is terrifying for me is that through learning all of this about myself, it has become very apparent that my oldest daughter, who is 6, definitely shows many symptoms of  .  So now, while beginning my journey to understand and treat my own disorder, I am trying to also understand it for her and find ways in which I can help her without medication because I just dont think this type of medication is right for a developing child.

Ok, I have a feeling this is going to sound like Im completely paranoid however it does make sense..   So I am in the middle of assessment phase, Ive done a couple of tests now but they are being spread out as the psychologist told me she wants to be through and clear because I am currently diagnosed with another comorbid condition. I am also in my 30s.   The first couple of appointments (Ive just had my 4th, due a 5th) I was asked if I wanted the lights off which I said yes to and then said thats alot better actually (please note that Im not fully aware of what my triggers actually are, I just know I get overwhelmed and want to escape, Im slowly picking up on things).   Anyway, the last session I had I started figgity like crazy and then itching. The blinds were fully open and the fluorescent lights were on. It was early afternoon on a very sunny, bright day and the room is plain and cream coloured so there is no need for the lights to be on.   I noticed myself starting to squint and I said to her that I was becoming tired, I remember rubbing my eyes at this point. I then mentioned that I could see and feel my pupil adjusting to light and that it was weird. I then pulled my hands down from my forehead downwards over my eyes down to my cheeks (I dont know how to explain this lol).   She then got up saying she would turn the lights off and this is when I noticed she was observing my behaviour (which is what a psychologist is supposed to do I guess). What stuck out for me is that there was a chair and a table in front of her and instead of looking where she was going and forward whilst walking to the light switch, she was locked onto me and my facial expressions and looked a little flustered. She had to turn towards me whilst walking to see this so that intrigued me.   So my question is that has anyone noticed that their psychologist may of set up the environment to see how you respond to certain triggers?   I mean they have to observe these behaviours right?

My tolerance has built up a bit and Ive always been a coffee drinker, so on days I take Adderall I try to limit myself to only one or two cups of darker roast or half caff/decaf - in the beginning I was scared to take anything with caffeine, but as my tolerance built I found one or two cups sipped throughout the morning doesnt give me jitters and helps wake me up.

I knew about it a month ago and it didnt even need to be that long: only five pages 1.5-spaced (I have no idea why the professor wanted 1.5 spacing). Needless to say, I didnt finish it, and I barely even started it. Im on this study abroad program where things are fairly chill so this isnt the worst thing ever but now I have to somehow explain this to the professor when I have no good excuse whatsoever and I have to play catch up and write this essay at some point even though its about to be the weekend and I have some things planned.

Somehow the thought of just doing my work and doing it well seems boring and I dont want to be bored, even if doing the ""interedting"" procrastinating alternative is so bad for me.

3302,Delta9_TetraHydro,0.0,"[Rant] I feel so stressed right now, i really hope my vacation will be enough time to solve everything","I usually work 40 hour weeks, with 10 hours of transport weekly. But lately i have had an extra shift a week because my collegue quit, and i have been training his replacement.  When i get home from work, i got more work. About a month ago I demolished a wall, tore off all my wallpaper, the floor panels, wooden doorframes and windowframes, and started making (holes?) for wires to get my contacts into the wall instead of running on the outside. I also built a soundproof wall to my neighbor, and are planning on soundproofing the ceiling as well.  I had to throw out all my furniture, because they took up too much space when we were building, it was too damn much. But that also means i have to buy new of everything when Im done, and the building phase has already drained my savings account.  On top of that, i am planning a big project for a festival, we start building in a month. I am kind of the head of this project, because... Well Ive been so all the other years. I got a little more help this time though, and my team is more experienced after having tried it a few times. I am NOT a professional myself.  And on top of that me and a friend is starting a foundation, which i really wish will be successful, Its probably the only one of my activities i see a real future in.  I sleep at my rommates room, while he stays with his girlfriend through the building phase. He still pays rent though, Im really lucky to have such a tolerant roomie.  I had hired an electrician student, who said he could easily pull the wires and all that, but i needed a professional to connect them. When the professional came, he told me that whoever pulled the wires must have been trying to kill me, and we had to open up the wall again and start over, costing me a bunch of money.  I cant use my kitchen because all the pipes from my radiators (i had to take them down to be able to take down the window frames) are lying across my kitchen and taking up all the space (its the only place thats long enough for the pipes to be there, even though they go from one end of the kitchen, and all the way out and blocking the front door from opening).  I have too much shit going on, i cant relax. I cant stop thinking of either one of my projects, every time my thought fade from one thing, it drifts to the next project and i start obsessing about that instead.  The only thing that can get me to think of something else, is Sekiro, because fuck that game and its flaming head bull bosses.  Im shitting blood and i suspect that i have a stomach sore from the stress. I dont know much about that though, its just something i heard you can get.  I start vacation next week, then i got three weeks off to get my apartment done, or at least livable. I have also said to my partner that we have to wait with the foundation, because i simply cannot handle all of that. To the festival crew i have also said that i will have to take a smaller role, but i cant back out then it wont happen. I am the driving force behind our project.  The next three weeks will be me trying to relax, and trying to get some work done at the same time. But only working on one project, the apartment, and then i can focus on the other things once my life is back together.

Ive tried to overcome my suspected   without help for a year+, didnt work and now everything sucks.**   Yikes this was all longer than I thought, sorry.   Lurker here. Without getting too much into my entire life story:Ive always struggled in school. A combination of awful sleep insomnia, inability to set aside time for studying/homework, and intermittent depression led to a not so fun school time. Also when being undiagnosed your whole life and living and in a household where school is a huge priority, it left me a lot of times feeling especially shitty when struggling. Family is not big on psychiatry/seeking help and I didnt have any of the stereotypical hyperactive signs of  , so I ended up as that kind of smart kid who just never did well in school for some reason.   Fast forward: Scraped by into college, still undiagnosed. Slightly better studying habits but its still a struggle, especially as college courses workload increases. I think at this point Ive re-taken about a full year of courses Ive failed/dropped? Super behind, all that fun stuff. About last year I managed to get it so my transcript is F-free and my GPA isnt a complete dumpster fire. Around that same time I had set up a plan to transfer to a different college like ive always wanted, and also happened to learn of the different symptoms of   in a Gen-Ed psych class, looked a bit more into it, several articles and watching a [specific video](https://youtu.be/ouZrZa5pLXk) later, it clicked, I had *a ton* of those symptoms, everything made sense. Huh, I have  . Thought I can manage it on my own though..  *I didnt seek help. 0 counselor visits, 0 office hours gone to, 0 psychiatry appoitments,* ***Why didnt I get help??***   No excuses really, probably some pure procrastination, probably something weird thing with how I was raised, and some   thrown in there I bet. There are literally not enough words to describe how upset I am with myself right now.   Long story short, undiagnosed   can kick your ass in higher level courses. And not passing several important ones in a time where your GPA/credits are really important, ***like when your about to transfer*** can really set you back and complicate your college life. Fuck. ^I ^want ^to ^crawl ^into ^a ^hole ^and ^die..   Kind of bittersweet, that is took *this many* mistakes for me to finally come to terms with finally getting help, even if its a bit late.

3322,ArivonceTheNerd,0.0,Thank you for validating me,"Hey  I discovered this subreddit earlier today and just kept reading and reading and reading. There were so many stories, inspirations, and tips.  You see, I was diagnosed at 19, only a few years ago. Even though I originally went to a psychiatrist for depression and  , he still saw the signs in me. At first, my family and I were surprised, they never saw the obvious signs in my childhood. I was the opposite from the stereotypical   kid.  Im lucky to have grown up performing excellently at school. I didnt really work hard for it, it just so happened that a lot of what interested me was what they were testing us on. I was far from responsible, but everyone just thought I was lazy. You know the archetype of the person who was naturally gifted without studying? For a long period of time, everyone was telling me that I was that. I barely studied, but was able to graduate with honors.   Then college happened. Im THAT kid whos grades radically dropped after changing environments. At first it was fine, majority of the subjects being taught in the first two years were somewhat covered in high school so I still kept up my barely studying attitude. It wasnt quite failing, a little above passing maybe. When I started taking majors, thats when the noticeable changes in grades popped up. I only started studying the night before, or even hours before major exams. I was barely passing, and at the end of the semester, failed multiple core courses.   I guess you could call that my wake up call. I fell in a hole and sought a professional. Thats when I was diagnosed. Everything made sense. So much behavior from my childhood that was attributed to immaturity suddenly had an explanation. My psychiatrist had me start with antidepressants first and while it did improve me a bit, it was clear that more intervention was needed.  A year later he prescribed 10mg Methylphenidate. Holy cow did it make so much of a difference. So much so that I didnt need to take the antidepressants anymore since a lot of my depression and   is rooted from the guilt of not performing well in school.  That was all before I found out about this subreddit. Reading through here was such a wonderful experience. I have certain behaviors that my family dislikes and finds incredibly annoying, and because of all of you I have more ways to explain my symptoms and hopefully work better with them to manage it. I dont really know anyone else with   in real life and I like having this community to relate to. This is great.  Whats the reason for the flair? I guess its for life in general. Im doing pretty great right now every since starting my   medication, my Psychiatrist is great (Im very lucky to have found a good one on my first try!), and Id love to participate here. I have more room to grow but I sure as hell am better off than I was before.   Anyway hopefully I didnt bore you with that rambling wall of text about my life.

I figured that the unrelenting fog that accompanied my mind was just the result of a day worked hard. It is a positive reward to feel this way, I reasoned. And thusly, no one seemed to give much weight, nor would one be signaled, to the fact that I was struggling with my selective attention, a lack which actually permeated every facet of my existence.  Throughout childhood, my parents and elders asked me to sit a little more still. By childhood, my older sibling inquired if I had some variant of Asperger syndrome. And by secondary school? “Just put your phone down and you’ll get your work done,” they said. But I couldn’t.  Instead, I came up with my own coping mechanisms. I focused on the curves of your ears, the bridge of your nose, or the asymmetric mole on your upper left cheek, even though you were speaking directly to me. The constant shifts of ocular focus helped me stay engaged in your words, even though I knew you were labeling me unengaged.  And these fidgety, heavily-stimulating mechanisms pulled me through. I finished high school near the top of my class. I struggled but graduated from Harvard. I entered a highly stimulating workplace in the financial world. By my mid-twenties, I founded my own hedge fund. The million stimuli that all demanded something of my attention obscured the fact that I was rarely ever actually processing one. But, no, no one thought I had some sort of executive function detriment. How could one possibly tell?  That changed when I changed careers and entered the book-heavy world of medicine. And there, I found myself failing to even hold onto a datum of the innumerable factoids assigned daily. Maybe I just didn’t know how to learn? By the serendipity of meeting a study-skills expert, one who had many-a-time discovered able-minded students hamstrung by their  , I was recommended to seek psychiatric assessment.   Zoom forward some time, a number of doctors appointments, and now I’ve got my first unopened bottle of prescription stimulant. As a big prude, I’ve never consumed any substance more dangerous than the caffeine in my morning coffee. At this point, I’m virtually a leather-jacket-wearing, helmet-less bad boy just by having this scheduled substance on my desk, right? The doc said this should be good for me.   I’m nervous to start medicating.  ———  Thanks for reading my story!

3340,AlliTink1,0.0,Who was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult?,"TL;DR  Trying to jump through the hoops to get an official diagnosis, curious if others who were diagnosed as adults struggled too.  I am a 43F. My brother was diagnosed very young, my dad was obviously   but never diagnosed, both my boys were diagnosed young.  At 10y/o I would cry for no reason and couldn’t explain why. I was diagnosed with depression and on and off various meds ever since.   I struggle taking my anti depressants for a few reasons, 1) they make me sick when I try to start them. 2) you need to take them regularly to make them work. 3) I struggle with my weight gain, and while it doesn’t cause it, it makes it harder to keep working to lose weight. 4) I hate the “numb” feeling I get after I have been on them for a long time, so stop taking them and repeat the cycle.   I was widowed at 34 and went back to school to be a teacher. This is when it started to become more apparent I may have   not depression. I would forget things frequently, forget to pay bills, procrastinate on homework to the point I retook some classes 3 times.   I went to a couple different   conferences because my boys have it and I’m going into education. One speaker in particular was describing  -I that is more common in females. Fidgety, but smaller movements, multiple things going on, notes and doodles, zone out, etc. I jotted these down on my notebook while my foot was twitching, and went back to the bubble popping game on my iPad as I zoned out thinking that kinda sounds like me. Everyone laughed at the speaker and I jumped, noticing several people looking at me.   When I met my new husband (a school teacher as well. I mention this because as teachers we see this frequently, not because we diagnose it. I need to be aware so I can help them) he was surprised I was never diagnosed. He would have bet money. 2 of his own kids are   as well as his ex.   So I really have been trying to be aware of when “depression” hits, if there is an   trigger that may have increased it. I stopped taking meds just to be aware and see. It is usually when I am so overwhelmed and can’t focus enough to knock tasks out. You can follow the trail when I clean. I’ll start in my room, find dishes take them downstairs and start the dishwasher, gather dish towels and do laundry, take clean laundry to my room, go through papers and pay bills... if I get that far.   So I went to the doctor I have seen for over 12-14 years. (He took over the practice from my previous 2doctors) and lay it all out for him. He tells me adult diagnosis needs to go through a psychiatrist, that the meds to treat that make everyone feel good so they want them, and said let’s try another anti depressant for a month and see if it is better.   I just hated feeling like he thought it was for meds I wanted to try this diagnosis. I know mood swings are normal. I know things that trigger my depression and avoid them. But I also want to know if this could be part of the problem.   Thanks for sticking out this long.

I listened to KIDS SEE GHOSTS and music had never sounded so amazing before. It sounded to vibrant, clear and empowering.

I was wondering why an incredible rush for only 45 minutes, and now feeling worse then I usually do? Is it possible that getting only 5 hours of sleep is the reason for this, or missing my morning dose has made my medication inconsistent? Should I take another dose in the afternoon or wait until tomorrow?     Is there any tips or guides anyone has on ensuring I get the most out of my medication?

Or - how have you made the same decision?  Main point:  Is there any evidence that points to long term side effects from medication use?  I keep going back and forth on whether or not to try again.  I know it would help, but I still have this lingering uncertainty of long term effects.    My story...  Two years ago I went to my pcp and talked about how I was having a hard time.  I was sad, unmotivated, didn’t feel like doing anything.  I was postpartum about a year and a half, with two other kids, sahm, and will go back to some form of employment once they’re all in school.  (Currently still a sahm, with an adjunct instructor side-gig.)  Anyway, at first I was put on depression meds, which made me sooo sleepy, and I didn’t really feel better, except that I was getting more sleep, because that last kid still wasn’t sleeping through the night.    Went back after a while after doing research on my own, and learning that   can look like (or lead to) depression, especially in women.    I related to alllll the stereotypical   stuff - procrastination, hyper focus, losing things to find them I put them in weird spots, or having a weird spot to put an item (like my car keys) and then them not being there, not sticking with a college major because I would get excited but yet would get burnt out easily and screw it all up and change my major again. (Ended up getting an interdisciplinary studies degree)   I feel like I was the incognito poster child/college student/adult for  ...and I didn’t realize any of this had a pattern until nearly 20 years later.  All of this time I thought I was just “a free spirit”...  Back to the Dr thing.  Did the questionnaire, prescribed generic Adderall.  It worked great.  I felt validated.  I felt like myself, was able to get stuff done.  Had to figure out dosing times to be able to sleep well at night, but that seemed like the only big noticeable adjustment.  And then the comedown...I would snap at my kids...wasn’t sure if it was the meds or me, or both.  So, after about six months, and reading too much about possible side effects of long term use, I decided to try without it again.  Now I find myself in the same place two years later.  I want to try meds again...it just makes me nervous as heck to call up the dr to make the appt, as well as possible long term side effects.

In one of our previous sessions (at this time I was already taking the antidepressants and they were in full effect), we discussed the topic of how Ive never really had any ""close"" friends or relationships in general, and I kind of got the sense that the way I socialize with and feel about other people isnt normal. **To sum it up, I basically told her that, while they were nice, I didnt really care about having friends and I had little to no interest in romantic relationships (romantic attraction is rare, ""aesthetic"" attraction is fairly common)**. She didnt outright say anything like ""oh thats not normal,"" but it seemed as if she didnt entirely understand how I felt. It was towards the end of the session, so we couldnt talk about it as much as I would have liked, and its been on my mind since then.  At our latest session, I brought up what we had talked about before and I asked if it meant something was possibly wrong with me (developmentally, emotionally, etc.). She said that everyone is wired differently and that lots of people prefer having small friend groups... until I gave her a more precise description of my feelings. **I explained that I just dont really connect with anyone on a friendship level, and being close to someone on an intimate/relationship level would probably drive me crazy.**  **We talked a bit more and she asked me a few other questions until she asked if Id ever looked into autism or discussed it with another doctor.**  About two years ago, I brought it up with my parents (after doing a lot of research) because there were just some qualities about me that werent normal, and  , depression, and   couldnt account for. My parents began doing their own research, even going as far as asking my doctor about it (who agreed that it could be a possibility and encouraged them to continue researching), until they discovered that testing/evaluation could end up being a long, expensive process and they stopped looking into it. When I realized no further action would be taken, I dismissed the idea and didnt bring it up again.     However, now my counselor has once again brought it up as a possibility. **So, before I try anything, like bringing it up with my parents again (and potentially wasting money), I would like to know:**  Has anyone else with   experienced something like this, or does this sound like something that could be related to  ?

3397,jammerparty,0.0,SEVERE Depression After Adderall Dropoff,"I finally managed to acquire a regular prescription of Adderall, which helps me immensely.  The crippling   and depression I struggle with daily disappear because—in my opinion—they are symptoms of a mind shaped by a lifetime of being   in society and feeling like everything you do is pissing somebody off, somebody is judging you, you’re not doing enough quickly enough, everyone will get annoyed and leave you eventually, etc.  Not to mention, I can actually focus and feel positive to the point that I realize that 98% of my life has been spent operating at 40% capacity.  I actually have the ability to organize my life and accomplish things.  I have patience.  I have optimism.  I have confidence.  I feel better as a person because of all that.  But it comes with such a soul-draining drawback that now I am considering stopping it again.  Right now, I take a 20mg XR in the morning and another regular 10mg in the afternoon when the first one starts to wear off.  About the same time every day (around 5 pm), I experience a sudden mental state that is so dark and hollow, such empty sadness, that all I can do is sit and stare into space, sometimes weeping.  Admittedly, I have been through a lot lately and have plenty to ruminate over, but this is very excessive.  I don’t even want to do lazy activities like watching tv or playing video games.  I don’t want to talk to even my closest friends and family, and when I do I snap at them and find myself feeling very nasty and spiteful.  It’s every day, at the same time.  This is completely unlike me.  If this is the cost of being fully functional for half the day, I would rather be halfway functional all the time.  Additionally, my daughter was also recently put on the same medicine: She takes a 20mg XR in the morning before school.  By the time she gets home, it’s wearing off and she is exhibiting the same sorts of behavior.  She is uninterested in anything past laying in bed on her tablet, and seems apathetic or irritable towards everyone and everything.  But she has never felt these sorts of things before and it’s scaring her (and everyone who cares about her).  Has anyone else had this kind of severe reaction when their Adderall wears off?  Is this common?  Is there something to help with the drawbacks without stopping the medicine?",1553731381,1553731382,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b6btym/severe_depression_after_adderall_dropoff/,False,False,1.0

You’re not sure how much it matters. You’re not sure how to deal with it so you put it off till later. You worry how it reflects on you. You wonder if you should apologise or explain yourself. Time passes, you do other things. You start to think it actually maybe matters quite a lot. You wonder if you should explain why it’s taken you this long to follow it up. You try and think of an explanation but whatever you say would just make you sound like the mess you are. Who are you kidding, why did you think you were up to this? This is the end of the road. With nothing to lose, you finally make the call. It turns out it’s not a big deal at all.  ~~~~~~~  (I’ve broken the cardinal therapy rule of not talking in the first person. Sorry.)  ~~~~~~~  I had a bit of a realisation today, a breakthrough maybe. Just because of the disparity between the catastrophe in my head and the reality of what happened. And the stress I put on my boyfriend on his day off, weeping and wailing at him.   The realisation: trying to convince myself it isn’t the end of the world is a non-starter. For one thing, I genuinely am a bit out of my depth, the stakes are pretty high, I can’t deny I have form for silly mistakes. So the attitude has to be that - whether it’s the end of the world or not - thats unlikely to determine what is the Right Thing To Do. The right thing will generally be to go back and ask again, check with my line manager, etc. In all likelihood, I’ll get the answer I’m looking for and that will be it. And even if my worst fears are true and I’m fired on the spot, that’s better (in my line of work, at least) than trying to cover it up and getting in even more trouble.  So I hope I can remember that next time, for the sake of my mental health, my career and my relationship. But I’m worried I’ll forget it all when the pressure’s back on.

This has honestly been the most helpful and supportive experience so far.     **So here we go:** **25f here, I was diagnosed at 5yrs old with ADD** (Ive learned its now called   - inattentive / those are the only symptoms I have/exhibit). Been on meds all through school and Uni.      As **I was diagnosed so young, I never really learned about ADD and all the symptoms until recently**. Ive always had comments like:  * Youre messy and disorganised * Do you not remember (conversation/important info/appointments)/ Youre so forgetful/ Youd lose your own head if it wasnt screwed on * Youre so emotional, stop taking everything so personally / you have a very low EQ * You have so much potential and would succeed if you just apply yourself * Are you listening to me/ what did I just say?  * Why cant you just do it? Ive told you exactly what to do? Just get on with it! * Youre so lazy, you havent achieved anything today. * Why do you have to leave everything to the last minute? * Youll grow out of it at some point  *...... I heard this from my mother yesterday....*  * Stop using it as an excuse/ theres nothing wrong with you/ everyones a little ADD.   Ive always just believed these people, and **never realised these were all linked to my ADD** **and I wasnt just some faulty/ lazy/incompetent human.** No one ever helped me to put a plan in place and teach me skills to make it easier for me to cope. Ive always just silently struggled through it and somehow managed on my own - and now suffer with major self-doubt, social  , fear of rejection, poor self-esteem and that lovely constant feeling of never feeling good enough.      With all of that, **I somehow find myself almost a year into my PhD** (Medical Science - Anatomy) overseas **and realising I dont have the personal skills to cope** with ""normal/easy/everyday"" tasks. **I honestly feel like my ADD is worse/ discovering it for the first time all over again**. Ive actively sought out assistance from Uni (Student Disability, Inclusive Learning Services, Counselling, etc.) and was brave enough to discuss my ADD with my Supervisors (I usually keep my diagnosis to myself, out of fear of being labeled as one of those people who just ""use it as an excuse""). My Supervisors seemed really supportive and understanding in the meeting but still dont ""get it"".      **Uni Support has suggested giving my supervisors a list of symptoms/ ways my ADD affects me and what helps me, so that they can understand, adapt and assist.** Which I agreed was a great idea! **However, Im still trying figure out my own ADD as an adult and what works for me.** Unfortunately the PhD is largely *independent and self-driven*, and does not allow being ""spoon-fed"" info/instruction/direction. There are also *NO DEADLINES*... They essentially just approve a topic and say: ""have fun! see you in 4 years with a 200 page book"" and there are no lectures and hardly any courses. Basically just a nightmare for someone with ADD and who thrives off forced routine and schedule and struggles to self-manage...      **Essentially...**  1. **Any suggestions for things I can try to keep motivated and not procrastinate?**  2. **Also how do I explain to NTs what symptoms I have, How they affect my Uni work, and What works for me/things Im trying to learn?** \- Keep in mind Im dealing with Academic Doctors and giving them anything without references/proof would just be laughed at...  3. **Any good websites I could link them to summarise/ explain the general struggles of an inattentive  er?**     P.S sorry for long post...

Should I get another opinion? I should add that when I feel that they’re not helping me, I hadn’t taken them with the belief that they aren’t going to work. I would take them, and just carry on with my day, not expecting wonder drugs here. The doctor has convinced me that it was all in my head which in turn was making me feel as if the meds had simply just stopped working, which was causing the effects of them to just go so quickly. Does it make sense?? I really hope he’s right, I do, but it seems like a long shot that if i “believe the medicine will help me now” that it will. Has anyone been told these things by their doctor?

3424,original_schmer,0.0,Help with motivation--or learning how to set limits,"I am lucky to say I have the perfect job for how my brain and my attention work. I help train students to learn the skills to guide conversations about complex social issues. I also pay close attention to the conversations themselves, so I can identify themes and patterns in both how the dialogues are going and in what kind of training the facilitators need. This is ideal for me because the interpersonal realm is always something that I have been interested in, so that means it comes naturally and I dont have to force my attention to stay on it (as opposed to other things that have felt impossibly difficult throughout life). Also just because of the nature of the job, I get to work largely on the big picture level and I mostly make my own decisions about how I prioritize my time and energy. Also I do this work remotely. So as far as jobs go, I couldnt ask for anything more suited to my own particular strengths and limitations.     That said, as the last couple of years have unfolded, it feels like my creative muscle that I bring to this work is just getting more and more worn. Its ultimately creative work, and more and more, that part of me feels like its on overload.  But I know this is the right work for me. When it is good, it is SO GOOD. I feel most alive when I am immersed in these conversation spaces. But something is out of balance--recently this creative part of me has just been saying ""NO, STOP, NO MORE!"" And I have learned through my own struggles with   that I HAVE to listen when my attention is saying NO to something--it will only lead me into a brick wall if I try to force it.      Sooo...how do I listen to this inner ""NO!"" response while also honoring the commitments I have made to those I am working with? And how do I hold this confusing mix of LOVING the work but also being on overload and therefore hating it? I dont know how to say ""enough"" until its too late. So now all I can do is withdraw.

3453,Sociallyanxious2020,0.0,Could I have ADHD?,"Hi Reddit, I recently found out that I **am not on the Autistic spectrum (very long story, but found out through multiple doctors and re-diagnosis so pretty sure of that).**     Still I have questions about some of my behaviour and whether this could perhaps be  , far from hyperactive as a child I was quiet and could easily sit still and was not disruptive in itself.      I was therefore surprised when I recently scored very high in an   test. My parents nor any doctor ever suspected it.     For information I am a 21 year old guy living alone as a university student.     Can anyone relate to the following symptoms as a kid and adult?     ***As a child (Until roughly 10):***  * Smarter than average, causing some social difficulties. But mostly smarter with things that did NOT involve difficult details (ability to read fiction at 14 year old level at 7 years old) and terrible at Maths or Language subjects involving rules. Also interests would very regularly change. * Could relate well to my peers and the things they liked, but got bored quickly. * Loved to daydream about situations in which I would be the center of attention, EVEN if I knew that this would be negative attention. * Had a particularly bad year in which I knowingly acted as a class clown to get attention. * Easily distracted by mundane things such as cars outside school window, but then could switch back quickly. * Otherwise normal social skills and could read people well but quickly BORED and sometimes disruptive. But always aware of my behaviour and its consequences. * Had crazy random business ideas, but all of them were about how customers would feel and not necessarily about whether it would actually work financially or details. * Easily distracted and wanted to grow up. Would look at things like train timetable, NOT to memorize it or care about details but to imagine what it would be like to be an adult and escape and travel. * Talked a lot with my parents, less with my peers. With both I could easily tell when they got bored or wanted to change the subject, but I wanted to keep talking. * Very emotionally intuitive but couldnt focus long enough on conversation to actually make friends. * Very occasional hand FLAP (but not flapping) if I got excited about something. No other forms of stimming and never when angry or other emotions. * NO sensory issues.     **Today as an adult:**  * Very high emotional intelligence and EASILY read other people and how they feel * BUT Still cant for the life of me seem to focus on long conversations and easily get drown out. Even though I perfectly understand people  when I am focused on them. * Easily keep up with everything but in a very disorganized way (e.g. Never get the laundry done, forget my shopping list). I literally live on the fly. * Impulsive buying, even though I already have food in the house, I will order a pizza just because it looks good. * HATE routine to the point that I can never seem to get through an entire week staying organized.  * Only time that I seem to be organized is when I am backpacking, because then nothing is predictable and suddenly things are exciting enough. * Love making small talk with people like shopkeepers. But get bored when my female friend explains her university degree for 15 minutes. * All my life is through emotional and abstract eyes and REALLY couldnt care less about details. This is however a problem because then I forget details like filing taxes. * I can reasonably focus on studying, but only if I go to a coffee house, library or anywhere that is NOT my flat. * Disorganized and easily switch between tasks. These tasks are always about the big picture and I cant seem to ever bother reading details.  * Rarely get all the tasks done, but will get a little bit of every task done. * Regularly get into fights with my friends, when I do things which I know are going to be seen as negative but will put me at center of attention * Crazy very spontaneous logic (today I dont feel like studying or I feel sad. Lets hop in the car and drive 100KM) * Thoughts that are all over the place, but in ALL types of different subjects.     My biggest issue is that I seem to have a weird need for attention, even though I am much loved by my friends and family. This need for attention causes serious issues in my relationships that have (in the past) led to drinking benders.     I get through the week reasonably well (rarely forget appointments etc.), but always disorganized and so easily distracted.     I developed Social   from a very young age, which I have only recently began to tackle.

Learning that I have ADD and how it actually works was truly a life changing experience and the only thing holding me back from embracing it is the hostility Ive gotten from my family over it. Im still under my parents health insurance, which doesnt cover my medication, so I have to pay almost $300 per month for my Vyvanse. I had no choice but to address it with my mom and step-dad, and while they ultimately agreed to pay for my medication until I graduate college, I cant bring up my   without it erupting into an argument. They insist that my doctor is just handing out prescriptions to addictive substances to make extra money (which Im aware is an issue in our health care system), that they never saw any signs of me having ADD (they have as much knowledge about it as most people do, and obviously dont understand how differently it can manifest itself in girls), and that Im blindly taking medication, even though Ive explained numerous times that I did extensive research before taking it, and they know that I avoid medication at all costs unless its completely necessary.  Ive tried multiple times to start explaining my symptoms, but my mom immediately shuts me down, saying that everyone has problems focusing today. I cant even get to the true issues that ADD poses in my life: interpersonal issues, anger issues, problems in my relationship, feeling innately stupid and lazy, etc. because she starts freaking out and I leave crying (this has happened 3 times now). I know she isnt trying to understand because she asks me the same questions repeatedly and when I called her out on it she admitted that she hadnt been listening the other times I tried opening up. Shes irrational, impossible to reason with, and truthfully I believe I got my ADD from her. Everything I hated about myself before I was diagnosed were qualities I believed I got from her, and it made sense when I learned that its often hereditary. I know it isnt my place to suggest to her that she may have it as well (especially when she doesnt even believe I do), but Im really at a loss for how to deal with this situation. I want to get help for her, but my main priority is to find a way to teach her what ADD really is so I can then get her to understand my experiences with it and stop having to hide that part of myself from my family.  Does anyone have any suggestions of how to make her more receptive to learning about it? Ive considered giving her a really helpful guidebook I have, but I feel like shell just point to the symptoms I dont have to ""prove"" that I dont have ADD. Not to mention I dont really want to have to tell her every detail about my personal life and how its been negatively affected by my disorder. It really isnt any of her business, but Id rather suck it up and share what I can than be on edge any time it comes up and have to hide such a big part of myself from everyone.

Every single job I’ve been in you name it marketing, program management, receptionist etc. At the start of the job at some point, I will be introduced to a computer programme or a company intrenet system they use to store information on e.g for a customer or billing or what have you. I will be assigned a trainer, they will show me step by step how to input information and use the program. Every time I always end up having to tell them to slow down because I have ‘ADD and I find it hard to concentrate and retain information at once’ to which they’ll usually say something along the lines of ‘oh my god, I have that as well (when 99 percent of the time they don’t have it) Don’t worry you’ll pick it up eventually!’   So I’ll try write down step by step the process of how to input information, but even then I’ll be overwhelmed. They’ll then ask me to try myself and I’ll keep making really dumb mistakes, like forgetting what internet tab I was on when I open another window.  Even after months of doing the same thing day in day out, I’ll always have to constantly refer back to my notes, which slows me down. Whilst everyone else seems to pick it up first time. On top of this I always make sloppy attention to details errors e.g. I’ll put in £50 instead of £500.

I’m irritated noticing my own behaviors!  I tried a friends medication after being diagnosed, and it was like a fog I had never noticed had been blown away.

Their brains don’t have all these random thoughts and ideas actively getting in the way of tasks??   I feel upset, like I’ve lost something I always thought I had (even though I didn’t).  I thought I was healthy with no issues and now I have a labeled brain disorder that’ll never go away. My husband doesn’t understand why I’m upset— I’m the exact same person he says.  Thoughts?

3501,Dmarek02,0.0,"A medical professional telling me ""everyone has ADHD"" and that I don't need a ""schedule 2 drug"" to function was upsetting","I went to see the Nurse Practitioner (who took some psychology classes) yesterday to refill my Wellbutrin prescription and ask about my other options for   medication. The last time we met,  she said the clinic insurance will only cover ""non-addictive"" medication but if that medication didnt work out,  she could prescribe any of the other medication with the understanding I would have to pay out of pocket. I explicitly asked her if she could prescribe Adderall or Ritalin with the understanding I would pay out of pocket. She said yes,  but to try the ""non-addictive"" medication first (Straterra).   After 3 full days of dedicated calling and coordinating between the clinic and pharmacy (got nothing else done those days), the clinic insurance denied my prescription for Straterra because they ""dont treat  "". Ok,  so I tell my SO and he shows me this website where meds are heavily discounted. My heart sinks when I see that Straterra is like $90, but I see that Ritalin and Adderall are around $30 or less so I feel a little more confident and take note of that for when I see the NP again.   Yesterday was our second meeting and when I brought up the   meds,  she laughed and said that she used to be able to prescribe Straterra because of a loophole but they closed that gap so she cant anymore. Hilarious 🙄😒. So I bring up our conversation where she said she would prescribe me the other   meds with the understanding I pay out of pocket. I explained Straterra was too expensive,  but other meds like Ritalin and Adderall are affordable with those coupons. She said she cant prescribe them because they are addictive. I pointed out Ill pay out of pocket and she can test my pee,  Im not an addict. She said no,  they treat drug addicts and people on probation at the clinic,  so she cannot prescribe me (the clear outlier) any ""addictive"" medication. She then said the only way I can get these meds is through a PCP. I complained that I had no idea how to get a PCP through the 2 clinic insurance plans I have and she said 2ndClinicInsurance doesnt prescribe schedule 2 drugs per the DEA. So I explained my brain is structured differently and for me,  it would be medication. Thats when she laughed and said ""everyone has  "" and that it is ""the most diagnosed disorder in psychology"".  I said No,  it isnt. She insisted that it is more common than bipolar and schizoaffective disorder. To which I was like ""Duh!  Those only affect like 1-3% of the population while   affects something closer to 15% of the population,  so when you compare 15% to 3%,  it looks more common! ""    With that,  she showed me out and Im set to see her again in a month.  I can barely contain my excitement /s.  Im looking for other clinics,  its just so difficult. Finding this one took 3 months and only when I saw the NP for the first time and asked for   meds did I find out that they primarily treat drug addiction and criminal rehabilitation.   On the bright side,  that clinic provided me with a case worker who recognized I am an outlier for the clinic and she is willing to learn about   and help me find resources to manage it.       TL;DR: The title of this post + if you are experiencing this,  you are not alone.       Additional notes/ context/ tmi: I pulled those numbers out of my ass at the time because its been a while since I looked at disorder stats in the US.  I have been working on changing careers after all (I majored in Psychology in college and took extra courses in Abnormal Psych bc Im a huge nerd,  didnt want to stick around for the Masters though). I looked up the numbers after coming home and being absolutely bothered by the NPs words. Turns out, I was much closer to being correct than she was,  by a large margin. Bipolar affects 2.6% of the population, while schizoaffective disorder affects 0.3% of the poluation.    affects about 11% of the population. The most common psych disorder in the US is  (-based disorders)  coming in at ~18%.   I cant afford regular health insurance because Im unemployed which is also why I cant try out different clinics and pay out of pocket. I dont qualify for unemployment because I voluntarily changed careers and left my last job.   The NP is all around kind of abusive. When I first came into her office,  she made me change where I was sitting and began arguing/ fighting with me because I asked her if she already got my info from the LPC who did my intake evaluation. I asked in a neutral/ ""Im curious"" tone,  not aggressive at all. She felt the need to raise her voice and argue with me because she ""is the doctor! "" (NP,  respectfully). *Im* the one who deescalated the situation and calmed both of us down so we could have a productive meeting. Then she started firing questions at me and I couldnt even remember what question she started with. I asked her to repeat the first question and she chose this time to take my blood pressure,  which was high (wonder if the arguing and confusion had anything to do with it). After about 10 very general questions and based on the words I used to answer them,  she diagnosed me with OCD,  Bipolar disorder, 2 disorders I actually have, and  -I. I have nothing against those disorders,  but I simply dont have all of them.  She may as well said I had a third arm coming out my back and that my eyes are purple; its just not true. She refused to even entertain the idea that I had the combined presentation of   because I didnt spontaneously do jumping jacks or fly out of my chair (I wish I was exaggerating) during the 40 minute interview where I was doing my best to wait my turn and not answer/ guess the rest of her question while fidgeting with my purse strap and phone case nonstop +jiggly leg. I said I have a ""bedtime ritual"" that helps my brain prepare for bed so I can get to sleep faster.  She took this to be undeniable proof of having OCD *rolls eyes*. Once I rephrased it to ""habits I keep before bed that are perfectly regular like dimming the lights,  brushing my teeth,  and keeping my phone out of reach"" (couldnt remember the word ""routine""),  that convinced her I didnt have OCD *facepalm*. She insisted I have Bipolar because I have mood swings. I explained my mood swings are too common, I can take a nap easily and need sleep to function (my body will demand it whether Im in class,  driving, at work, at a bar,  anywhere), and I dont have manic symptoms at all.  I remembered from Psych class and when I was evaluated in college (I was worried I had Bipolar)  that I need to present manic symptoms to have it,  otherwise,  its just Depression,  which I got diagnosed with. She smiled smugly and told me to look it up. I said I would.  Then she prescribed me meds for   and bipolar.

Deciding to, and then following through with the decision to quickly take the rubbish out in freezing weather isn’t so hard. You feel pretty shitty in the cold weather but then you come back inside and feel great.   Now imagine the opposite. It’s always freezing everywhere you go, and you’re constantly trying to find any kind of warmth wherever you can get it. Then once you find some warmth you’re very reluctant to leave.   With   we feel at least a bit shitty all the time. (always freezing)   Our brains are constantly distracted trying to find something else to concentrate on to make us feel better. (Trying to find warmth)   When we concentrate on one of the big 4 (new, challenging, urgent, personal interest) we feel better. (Found some shelter)   Once we find something better to concentrate on we have a tendency to hyper-focus on it and procrastinate doing what we ‘should be’ doing because, even if only sub-consciously, we know that doing the ‘right thing’ is going to feel horrible. We’re scared of going back. We can be emotionally unstable; scared, sad, angry or anxious because of this, even if we’re not aware of the reason. (Reluctant to head back out into the cold)   For some extra insight, *typically*:   Freezing weather = chores, work, school, homework, anything boring, exercise etc.    Warm Shelter = Favourite TV or movies, video games, daydreaming... ... reddit etc.   This is why a lot of people think we’re lazy; “you can play video games all day, but you can’t do the washing up?!?”.

So basically I always had a really hard time in school, I was in the “reading group” for kids who were falling behind, I was called a “day dreamer” by my teachers &amp; for years my teachers would say things beating around the bush but nonetheless saying that I was falling behind.   It was clear and evident I was struggling with   &amp; a learning disability my whole life. I would fall behind and just not get the content at all, I was made fun and called stupid all throughout elementary school and middle school. &amp; I truly believed I was stupid because I just wasn’t getting things like everyone else was. I actually believed I had a vision problem because I couldn’t understand why the words I read weren’t going into my brain but I had perfect vision I was just dealing with a processing issue. My grades were never stellar although I managed to pull through and some how my report card grades would be better then my individual but never perfect when I got older and starting dealing with more mental health problems they declined further.   I absolutely came to loathe school &amp; when my other illnesses were piled on I devolved   towards going. It brought me so much discomfort. I hated feeling like I couldnt learn or that I was stupid and then on top of it being called stupid all throughout school. I was known as being pretty &amp; dumb.

Every month I have to ask for my prescription the day its due or the night before and whether or not its convenient for me to get it that day, they dont care.  I have never broken my drug contract, I have never abused my medication, and I have never failed any drug tests in any way, and discussed medication changes with my doctor if I needed to.  I have had my dosage increased once and that was a year ago and asked for a instant release in the evening instead of increasing my dose again on my extended release.    I dont feel like I should be this micromanaged.  They refuse to write a few months ahead of time for the pharmacy to refill automatically even though I only have to go for checkups every 4 months.  I never miss my checkups.  I never ask for pain medication.  I dont sell my medication.  Example:  My extended release is filled on a different day than my instant release.  The instant release was started mid month.  My doctor said, ""Fill this today, but heres the Rx for the extended release for you to fill next week.""  I did exactly that.  When the instants ran out a week before the extended, I submitted a refill request for the instants the day before I was supposed to get them so I didnt end up with a gap.  I get a call two days AFTER they were due from a nurse who Ive never seen and I was told I was filling them too early.  ""No, Im not.  They were due already.""  ""They arent supposed to be filled until the 25th.""    ""No, they were supposed to be filled on the 17th.""  ""No maam, the doctor said it was the 25th.""  ""Im looking at my Rx bottle.  It says the Rx was written on the 18th.  It says date filled is the 18th.""   ""Oh, well, Ill take another look.  If youre right and you REALLY are out, well fill it.""  I almost filed a complaint with my insurance company, but then again, I didnt want to cause a stink when Im already on an overly short leash.  She accused me of drug seeking behavior without outright saying it.    I have zero way to fill and pick up my Rx in the morning on the day its needed.  I have two small kids. I cant put them in the car and go to the pharmacy and get my Rx on time and still take them to school...  But I dont want to look like Im doctor shopping.    For years I didnt take this medication because I was afraid of this exact scenario.  Am I going to look like Im drug-seeking?  I have one more visit with my regular doctor next month.

I would still really appreciate understanding friends, great advice/feedback, and help finding a better job or a partner :)   -- Im keeping the above to show the contrast between where I started and where I ended!      **But, I think the area that frustrates me most is my career because:**  * Ive been bouncing across different companies (and long stints of unemployment) the past 10 years, and I havent been able to find a place that is both a good match for me and pays well. * Despite being very intelligent (""gifted""), extremely well-read, curious, an excellent problem-solver and researcher, creative, tech and trend-savvy, hard-working, dedicated, optimistic, open-minded, well-traveled, bilingual, passionate, a strong communicator/convincer, and not bad socially (but lacking social drive or a strong network), my   and personal characteristics make it hard for me to stay motivated over the long run without getting fired or quitting.     **My job challenges:**  * While I would love to ""be a successful entrepreneur,"" Ive discovered that I suck at working alone, and would need a complimentary partner to succeed. Ive lost a lot of time and money on failed ventures both alone and with the wrong partners :(  * When it comes to getting fired, my biggest problem has been time management, though I suspect the only reason Ive been fired from a few roles is because Ive stepped on too many toes or somehow alienated certain people. Im not very good at ""playing politics,"" and I tend to bend or challenge dumb rules and processes. *  I have a hard time ""accepting things as they are,"" but I think a lot of people are overly-sensitive and think I am criticizing them when I just want to help make things better. I always want to feel like Im working for ""the best"" or towards (us) becoming the ""the best,"" but a lot of people dont understand this or care.      **I begin to lose motivation and dislike the places I work when I feel that they:**  1- are mediocre or old-fashioned, and not striving to improve or helping/allowing their employees to grow and thrive.  2- dont appreciate me or other employees and/or are not fair to us, or dont listen to us.    3- are jerks, liars, idiots, micro-managers, or just straight shady and/or insincere people.   4- dumb, slow, illogical or inflexible rules and processes (1-4 often go together).   5- Low pay and/or crappy benefits and/or crappy work environment (often tied to #2 btw).   6- doing/selling products and services that are not ""best-in-class"", or especially when not beneficial to people/society.   7- disliking my job itself, which has been a problem most of my career since I fell into sales and almost always disliked most of it, though there were parts I enjoyed, as well.   * Thankfully, Im doing marketing now, and though there are a lot of things that are not ideal and Im not happy about where I am, marketing is definitely more intellectually stimulating than most sales (and Ive done complex consultative selling, not just transactional type stuff, which I see as hell-on-earth)! I do miss traveling and meeting new people though.        **Most of my jobs have followed the same shitty trajectory:**   I would start excited, but then within 3-6 months the things above would start to show, and Id lose the excitement, so Id start to push back against management to try to improve things and often got in trouble. Finally, Id start missing more work, and getting in later and later with more frequency, until finally they would release me or Id quit.      **My Vision/Ideal Situation**  Despite all of the above, I know that if I found the right partner/company/job/boss/mentor(?), I would not only thrive personally, but would also make a very large impact, as well.     * I really want to make the world a better place, and I want to ""die empty"" and satisfied with what Ive done.     **When I am fired up, its hard to stop me** from convincing everyone around me about that thing too, and I love my ability to find interconnections between disparate things, comb through data, research, convince others, diagnose problems, find solutions, come up with strategies and, most importantly, really see the big picture while also having a million different ideas to succeed in creating it.     I can literally work for 24+ hours straight without tiring, but at the end of the day, I still need someone to help me get shit done.  I really wish I could find my ideal partner(s) in life and work.      I always imagine my ideal partner as being an ""operational/technical"" bad-ass that is great at getting shit done and managing things, but also shares my vision and purpose in what we are doing, while tolerating my   tendencies. We would make an amazing team!      But, even if I dont find a partner anytime soon, finding a suitable job, company or even boss, that can really leverage my capabilities and look past my flaws would be life-changing for me. It really sucks feeling like a fish out of water.      **If anyone has any ideas, job referrals, recommendations/advice, etc. that would be highly appreciated!**  I would be willing to work remotely or travel anywhere in the US or worldwide for the right opportunity :)      \~\~  **Important Postscript: My Realization that   is both my Superpower and my Kryptonite**  While writing this post, **Ive realized that despite all of the challenges that   has created in my life, I dont hate it, Im actually grateful for it.**      Because of all of the hardships Ive gone through, it used to bother me when some people called   a superpower, because I certainly didnt feel that way. However, the more I think about it the more it is clear that it is my superpower. Ive always known and believed that our hardships are often what make us stronger and prepare us for whats ahead, but for some reason, I didnt connect my   to that belief. It just felt like an impediment--something ""wrong"" with me that needed to be meditated away. Im sure that belief just made things harder on me.     Ive realized that, even though Im ""smart,"" my   is what has really expanded my horizons and given me my unique capabilities. I know many very intelligent people who are nowhere nearly as inquisitive as I am and/or who are very conventional and stuck in their ""boxes."" I love thinking outside the box and imagining new boxes to place things in.      If it wasnt for  , I would probably feel more pressure to conform, not following my hearts intellectual or experiential desires down every rabbit hole and back alley. I wouldnt have half the experiences I do, and I wouldnt know about so many random things that somehow my mind is able to find connections between.     I dont want to be conventional, and I dont think that is the path to success or happiness for anyone else, either.      Ive worked really hard to improve myself, and will continue to strive to grow and become a better person, but I dont want to wrestle with my   anymore--I dont want to wrestle with MYSELF anymore. Im never going to ""overcome""   because it is a part of me, so I really need to accept that and better integrate it into my life--whether society likes it or not.      But, to succeed and be happy, I do feel like I need to find the right situation and surround myself with the right tribe of people who do accept it and help me use it. We all have a desire to be seen, known, heard, appreciated and benefited from, and without a tribe that is difficult to get.      Perhaps that is what Im yearning for more than anything else, and maybe that is the missing puzzle piece that will unlock all of the other doors for me. So, hopefully, posting this is the first step to achieving that.  \~\~\~   Ive found a lot of solace in reading other peoples posts on this subreddit, it has truly been heart-warming and self-affirming, so hopefully this post will help do the same for others.

Psychiatrist is suggesting concurrent add-ons (benzo, esp Guanfacine, Propanolol) but Im hesitant to take meds for med side effects. Anyone had bad ""crashes"" that they remedied somehow (med or not)?   I know none of you are doctors and when it comes to meds ymmv. However, my psychiatrist also thought it would be a good idea to seek as many others experiences as possible.  I wish there was an active Reddit on   medication questions, side effects, experiences, interactions with other mental health meds, because from what Ive seen here (lurking in my main account), the psychopharmocologic complexities of   treatment are not the focus of this sub. I have not found other non-Reddit forums that are active and focused on discussion of   medication specifically. If I am wrong, please direct me to one. Aside from personal need, I am fascinated by this topic.  Ive tried almost every single   med out there hoping to mitigate my depressive and/or irritable feelings when my meds wear off. Irregardless of dose, IR vs XR, methylphenidate vs amphetamine, eating/drinking/sleeping/exercising adequately, nothing has helped. I should add that my medication has helped my   symptoms greatly. Also,  I have no other side effects--I sleep even better than before and my appetite is fine. However, my emotional state when the meds wear off is so bad that it makes me not want to take them--which screws up my job, my relationships, my car insurance, my possessions remaining in my possession, etc.  The only time I do not experience these negative feelings are when I take a small dose of benzodiazepine as per my doctors suggestion(half of what I am prescribed as PRN). Since this worked great, my doc offered to increase my script to ""take once per day in the PM"" (with my PM stimulant dose) but I do not want to take a daily benzodiazepine.I  One other suggestion is pairing my last dose with propanolol (blood pressure med), but she thinks the best shot for me is immediate-release guanfacine. Its  another blood pressure med but one that is a second line treatment for  , although Ive never heard of someone taking it for stimulant drop-off or otherwise (if Im wrong let me know--this is why asking about meds can be helpful despite our lack of medical degrees). Ive already tried non-stimulant meds for  --Straterra was the worst, Wellbutrin did nothing except make me simultaneously tired and anxious.  She also suggested meditation or exercise during that time. Id have to radically disrupt my schedule to do the latter (and my exercise time works for me now). The former has always been impossible for me before medication, and of dubious benefit afterwards (sitting and ruminating instead of acting is my number one problem, and even if I ""let the thoughts flow past me"", Im still adding to the time I spend thinking instead of doing).  But! If meditation or anything else (including meds I have or have not mentioned) has helped anyone, please let me know. Fyi, my diagnoses are  -PI, ASD, and GAD.

3581,erratic_pulse,0.0,Maximizing effectiveness of Adderall XR,"Had Adderall XR 20MG for a month. It works like nothing else ever has, but Im frustrated it doesnt last longer. Even XR seems to be ~8 hours, 10 at most.  The effects are immediate and fantastic. Im just a better person. Normally theres some kind of disconnect between different parts of my mind and my body, some sort of desynchronization. Some parts are slowing down, others accelerate. My body feels clumsy and unwieldy. I stumble around and trip on shit. Im angry and bored all day. Adderall fixes that. I can control every aspect of my own consciousness and thought, and have the energy I normally lack to boot. I turn into someone completely different, to the point that people around me seem to seriously notice that Im more efficient and just kind of better at everything. The full potential buried deep inside of me comes out and Im great at something as long as I try. And trying, executing the task, taking that step to actually *do it* - isnt an impassable barrier anymore.  The effects arent completely transformative, I *can* be as good at something off adderall as I can be while on it. The adderall is just like a jolt of otherwise-scarce ""consciousness fuel"" that makes it easier for me to control myself. If I want to work on some project, but cant muster the power, I can get really pissed and force out an immense amount of effort to do it poorly and comically slowly. But if I want to do that project as I should, and do it some justice, the Adderall facilitates it. If not for that, it might have been days before I had the necessary power to do it on my own.  However, this is starting to read to me like some kind of tragedy. I dont see this ending well for me.  The dose does its job PERFECTLY, but its tragically short. If Im having a good time, or pursuing personal interests, a deep-seated dread and guilt comes over me. I was blessed with lucidity and perfect mind-body synchronization, and I waste it on *this*? One less day on the clock, one rotation closer to the eternal end, and I wasted it. As time goes on I find myself having to try harder and harder to think in an organized way and perform precise tasks. I *feel* it getting harder to put my thoughts and ideas into action through my body. I can still do things, but it slows down and the organization starts to disintegrate. I feel it falling away, and I pretty quickly revert back into the normal, moody, cant-pay-attention person I was before.   That person cultivated a lot of bad habits over the years and probably made his own symptoms worse by atrophying any ability to summon willpower. I think I recognize the catch here. Yes, it gives me a temporary shot of willpower and control, but thats not worth anything on its own. Its just a flash in the pan. Priority one is to work on putting it towards useful things that dont make me feel that I wasted it. My conscience was willing to tolerate a month of inaction and normal slack-off operations on Adderall, but now I NEED to have something to do. My conscience can wait no longer. Ive got to feed that urge with something that isnt recreational or Ill go nuts with guilt over what Im wasting.  Whats more is that the more days I take it consecutively, the less I feel it. I took it yesterday and barely felt anything at all, very slight energy boost but was still disorganized, unmotivated, and uncoordinated all day. For today, I slept as much as I could, ate a good breakfast and waited for it to settle before it kicked in, and now its *pretty okay*, but today wasnt as noticeable as earlier this week. I know exactly why. My body is building tolerance, and soon it wont do anything at all. I cant lose this so soon, I havent had the time to properly wield it yet. Ive only just mastered the negative side effects. Using this to its full potential, I know for a fact that I can transform my life as it is. Is there some place I can read more about how to circumvent this insidious tolerance building? So far, a day or two off has done wonders to reset the clock. But if that stopped working, Im not sure what Id do.   This brings me to my point. I need to know how to maximize this. The length is disappointing. The effects seem to diminish over time. I dont want to lose it, and I refuse to take any more than I already do, thats a one-way trip. My research has turned up a few things that could be related:  -Acidic stomach content causes XR to absorb all at once, resulting in intense but useless 4-hour metal-blaring videogame sessions. Acidic content means citrus, tomatoes, soda, peanuts, many other types of nuts, fish, salt. Made me kick my nasty soda habit, for what its worth. I need to look into this more - there are resources for people who cant have acidic foods due to health problems. Looking into those could be worth my time.  -Ive noticed the best results taking it a few hours after food, a short while after you feel its fully settled.   If you take it with a meal, or too soon after, the effects are noticeably diminished so as to be less useful. Ive even had doses go completely unnoticed because I took them shortly before/after eating, nothing seemed to happen at all.   If you take it on an empty stomach, the rush is dirty and intense. Its like it speeds itself up. You feel it in every inch of your body. Feels like youre gonna fucking explode, and you surge with raw, uncontrollable power... For three or four hours before passing out. I guess the limited nutrition and energy you have to work with get burned out. Waking up tomorrow on the brink of death because you havent eaten in 24 hours is unpleasant to say the least.  So youve got to make sure you have enough fuel in the tank, but the food cant still be absorbing or itll be a dud. Ideally youll want to eat a huge, healthy and hearty breakfast early in the morning and take the dose once thats fully settled. Lastly, Ive noticed that eating while the dose is active can make it a dud, too. I ate dinner today after it was fully kicked-in and I quickly felt tired, muting the second half a fair bit.   -Improper amounts of sleep seriously fuck up the dose for me. If Ive underslept the night prior, the medication wont work as it should. It may make it significantly more muted, it may not last as long, it may last too long as I become tired but unable to sleep. You need a strong consciousness baseline for it to work, one thats supplied with a proper amount of sleep.  -Exercise boosts something to do with dopamine, or so they say. Ive heard exercising a few hours before the dose can noticeably improve and lengthen its effects. Its been a pretty good while since Ive worked out and really pushed myself, Ive gotten lazy over time. Physical fitness is likely to bring serious improvements, so I guess I have no choice but to get back into it.   This is all Ive turned up but there has to be more to it than just this.  Hopefully you guys have some answers. If you have any information that could even be remotely useful to maximizing adderalls effects, dont hold back.

I went in at 2am on March 15th and didnt come out until 9:30am. I had lost all of my immediate friend circle within a week of each other, all of them just cut me off. I was failing classes and missing exams. I was depressed and lonely and didnt know how to cope. I wanted to drop out of school most days. It felt impossible to get out of bed.

I wouldnt have gotten therapy for depression and  . I wouldnt have gotten diagnosed with   and never would have started treatment for it. I would never have travelled halfway across the country. I would never have become closer with my now best friend. I would never have met my current boyfriend. I would never have gone to see BTS in September.

Im being vague cause this might be long.   Well, his OT comes out and is like ""we are treating him for   right?""  Followed by a huge apology and that she cant diagnose, she thought based on his behavior with her that he was and she should have double checked her chart- it wasnt shocking to be honest... so she talked with pedi, we showed her the behavior charts from school which were done for OT/Pedi/DS2 and got a referral. NOBODY- pedi, teacher, director of school, husband, anyone who knows this child is surprised.   Pretty cut and dry eh?   Well here is the snag in all this. We have wonderful insurance. 300/per person, 600/family max oop, no copays save ER visits. 100% paid after the max 600/300. We have hit the family/individual with OT.

I worked in a group with her all this school year(both semesters) and working with her has inspired me to take bigger steps toward functionality. I’m still far off but I’m actually moving somewhere.

I had a week trial of 5mg IR, and then a week without it after to compare and talk about with my doctor. Anyways, long story short it worked well, though not as well as it could, I have been put on 10mg XR instead. Today was my first day with it and, while I understand theres a euphoria that wears off with time, it was a very productive, good day. I think the XR is a good match though it might be too early for that anyhow. Anyways, while I know the euphoria wears off, from what I hear, the effectiveness of what it is *meant* to do to help   should still last and be the same.     So, my questions are:  1. How does tolerance work? Do you build up a tolerance? How long does it take to develop if you do?  2. Can I skip doses? I did ask my doctor about this and he seemed fine with it, which it makes sense to me if I can and it seems less wasteful for days where I am fine being a scatterbrained mess (or breaks during school).    1. What happens if I skip a dose? Do I get hit really hard by the ""fuck you"" train? Or am I just me, unmedicated, again? Does it depend on how long I have been using it?

3622,asterearth,0.0,Not feeling the effects of Adderall,"Hi all, I am a college freshman and I was diagnosed with   (inattentive type) almost 3 weeks ago. My doctor started me off with Adderall XR 10mg and I tried it for 2 days and didnt feel anything so I told her and she told me to have 2 10mg XR pills at once instead (to make it 20mg). I tried that for about 5 days and didnt really feel any difference so I told her that and she gave me a weeks supply of 30mg XR to try. I tried 30mg the first day and I dont think I felt any different. The second day I tried it again and it was the same outcome so about 4 hours later of taking the pill, I had another 30mg XR (I know I shouldnt have but I just wanted to know if it would be any different) and to be honest I didnt really feel much of a difference with that either (maybe slightly). So my question is if it possible to be immune to Adderall in any way, and if should I keep increasing dosages or should I stay on 30mg for a while longer to try it out or should I ask the doctor to change the drug to an alternative one (like Ritalin or Vyvanse or something)? I was really keen on experiencing the effects of Adderall and improving my concentration because I have heard and read so much about how much it helps people and even my doctor said it would help me out a lot but it hasnt at all in my opinion (if it has then barely).

One thing Ive learned is that even the strictest policies can be bent very easily.   Faculty have had lots of experience with students trying to game the system, so they often get very strict in their official policies (all the stuff in the syllabus). That said, they will generally do whatever they reasonably can for students who are legitimately making an effort.   First off, register with your schools disability resources department. That makes it official and makes it a lot easier for your teacher to give you leeway.   Next, talk to your faculty regularly. Go to office hours, make your face known. Being friendly, showing up to office hours, and participating in class regularly can score you a lot of leniency when it comes to late assignments or attendance policies. Remember, they are people too and most of them their own idiosyncrasies (thats why they fit into academia).   Lastly, if you have done all of the above but you run into someone who just wont work with you at all then you have some choices to make. There is lots of advice I could give here, but realistically nobody is going to read it. If you have a specific question let me know, Ive had plenty of experience contacting Deans and department chairs because of issues in the classroom. I can help you phrase things correctly, or tell you when there really arent any good options.   TLDR: Register with SDR. Be friendly, show that you care as best you can.

It’s not distracting like a phone, it’s more subtle than a noisy alarm, and it’s always on me.

I used to miss my stop all the time because I was caught up reading something or lost in thought, but I haven’t done that since I got my Fitbit. And I’m actually able to enjoy whatever I’m doing on the train because I’m not terrified I’m going to miss my stop!  - I have an alarm for 4 pm every day because that’s usually when I’ve gotten caught up at work and forgotten to eat and then I binge on something and feel awful, especially if I want to work out after work. I also have one for 10 pm that reminds me it’s getting late and I should probably start getting ready for bed (this one is less effective because it’s not food, but it’s still helpful).   - I do a pomodoro-ish method for work so I’ll set an alarm for 25 minutes of work and when it goes off it’s my reminder to breathe, relax my shoulders, get more water, go to the bathroom, etc.  - To remind me to go to meetings. I get the notification on my laptop 10 minutes before a scheduled meeting, which is useless because I will forget it immediately, but I use *that* notification as my signal to set a timer for 8 minutes.

3662,goldenkumara,0.0,"ADHD in corporate environments, trying to do good in the world","Hey friends.   I’m on mobile, insert obligatory apology for formatting etc here. This is probably going to be a long post, TLDR at the end.  I’m feeling really dejected and helpless and could use some advice.  When I was first diagnosed about a year ago, I was so relieved because things finally made sense. There was a reason for my symptoms, resources I could use and medication I could take.   I read a lot about   in the workplace and recognised a lot of the positive traits that were mentioned in myself. I was studying at the time and with the meds I had been newly prescribed, things were looking positive for the first time in a while. I knew I was driven, intensely curious, passionate, and had the ability to think critically and analytically in a way that was different to others.  Until today, I’d seen my   mostly as a minor inconvenience, and partially as an asset. I knew I had to work harder than others to achieve the same results, which was frustrating but something I’ve just always accepted.  I just came out of a meeting with my boss to discuss my career progress. For context, I had set this meeting up as I’ve been put in an awkward situation at work (not through anyone’s ill intent, just a perfect storm of events within the business) where I’ve ended up doing much more than what’s in my job description and salary.  My boss agreed that the work I do is more than what would normally be expected. But he said he’d had conversations with some of my superiors, and that there was a general consensus that to progress within the company I needed to work on my communication skills. He said one colleague had even described my communication style as “forceful”.   This came as a complete surprise to me, and I’m honestly pretty upset about it. I have always seen communication as being a strength of mine. I acknowledge that I am very passionate about the work I do, and that I’ve been frustrated by the stagnancy within my business unit, but I have always tried my best to (and succeeded at, I thought) communicate professionally and effectively.  I’ll admit that my top priority has always been to get things done, to make things happen, to push for things and take initiative. I have a very low tolerance for corporate BS.  But I never thought that I was doing more harm than good. My boss implied that I’m staining my reputation and that I need to “play the game” if I want to succeed in this company. He said he understands that I don’t mean things to come across harshly, but that they do nonetheless.  So now I am feeling very lost. I don’t want to compromise my integrity and passion by diluting my thoughts so I can compete in their meaningless rat race.  I want to fix problems and help people.  I get so frustrated by the tunnel vision of people around me, by this corporate culture with all its nuances and unspoken rules, by capitalism in general.  So maybe this isn’t the right environment for me. But I still feel a need, almost a responsibility, to stick around so I can drive change from the inside out.  I want this to be a learning experience for me, but at the same time I don’t want to waste my energy on something that’s impractical.  Now I know what quite a few of my colleagues think about my communication, and I’m ashamed about it. I want to run away and start over, but I have nowhere to go. I flunked out of uni in my last semester due to family and mental health issues, which I haven’t told anyone about. Everyone thinks I’ve finished my studies and that I’ll be graduating in May.  I feel paralysed by needing to find a way to make a meaningful contribution with the work I do.  Is driving change from inside a corporate environment I’m probably not suited for the best way to do that? If not, then what are my other options?  Thank you for reading if you’ve come this far. I really appreciate it. I’m sorry if this was a bit of a ramble.  TLDR: boss told me my communication style is too forceful for our corporate environment.

From the 1st grade, the studying for me was kinda easy, but when I got to the 3rd or 4th grade, it started to get dificult. I started to loose interest in studying more and more, and I got more and more distracted. Now I am in 12th grade, have 1st part of the final exam in monday, and guess what, my problem didint fixed it self, the more I grew, the weirder I got. I do not know what to blame or what to do, maybe this problem I have is becouse of my first computer and lack of communication with my own age friends?  When I turned 16, my mother released me from the leash. I got my moped license, and got my first (hanging arround in the city) friends. Had a lot of them, but then I realised most of them was only making fun of me, so I decided not to talk or hang out with them anymore. Now my friend circle is small, I have 4 close friends, and 2 not so close friends. I am 18years old now. My so called friends rarely texts me, and mostly text me only when they need something, I know that this is the first sign of bad friends, but, what should I do? I do not want to loose them, I tried talking to them about my Slow Proccesing Speed, but now I regret that I told them that, becouse now I always feel like they think that I am ""retarded"", and maybe thats why they do not want to talk to me?  Right now, I am really working on my communication skills, I always try to speak faster and clearer, becouse I am very quiet, but when I open my mouth, most of the time, I just get confused and forget what I talked about and drift appart, and everyone thinks that I am weird again.  If any of you understood what I wanted to say, can I get some advice? Maybe medication?

Then told him to move to his exercise area, bedroom, living room and bathroom. I told him to break down each step that needs to be done in each area.

3686,FukBitchesGetPickles,0.0,Misdiagnosed for nearly a decade and my life is in shambles,"Hello,  Its very nice to meet you. TL;DR at the bottom. Otherwise, prepare for a shit-frosted crepe-cake of layered life drama.  I was originally diagnosed Bipolar NOS when I was 15. I had been struggling in school for several years at that point but always managed to pass, even skipping a grade. The depression came early on in my life and seemed to be punctuated by short periods of high energy, motivation, and general well-being. It made sense at the time.  Never mind the cycle of new, heavily sedating medications. I was literally on a drug that made me sleep at least 14 hours a day for over a year, and *still* had me falling asleep in class. I woke up from my after school naps only to shovel a much food into my body as possible; it seemed to be the only emotional comfort I had, and I never seemed to feel full until I was actively nauseous. My grades suffered some more.   Very suddenly, my psychiatry office stopped accepting my insurance. My only real option was to quit treatment altogether; the next-nearest psychiatrist was too far for anyone in my family to drive on a regular basis. My grades dropped once again, but I graduated high school and decided to go to college accross the country to get away from my awful family.   Unfortunately, I picked a very expensive college and thought I ""grew out"" of my mental illness. Terrible mistake. Not only were my symptoms unmanageably worse, I developed generalized   on top of it. I only left my dorm room to work, I was supporting my now husband and my disabled roommate so not going wasnt an option. I couldnt go to class; I couldnt leave our dorm without sobbing. I tried switching to online classes, but since I still had to work to live, I couldnt manage and I dropped out. I also left that job since I wasnt being paid (I could tell you a whole lot about life and health insurance but I couldnt sell it to save my life.)  I worked several different places after that, but we barely scraped by every month. I married my husband and we started our life together both unemployed and both in horrible mental health states. We were in a fluctuating state of no or bad psychiatric care and being supported by his parents, who were equally as awful as my family in different ways, for another two years.   All this while, every psychiatric professional I had talked to told me my lack of focus, my life-ruining allergy to deadlines, my uncontrollable *do-it-amazingly-or-dont-do-it-at-all* reflex, my extreme disorganization, all of it was brushed under the ""racing thoughts"" symptom of bipolar disorder. ""It will get better with meds,"" they said, cycling me through the billionth new sedative medication combination. ""Youre just hypomanic,"" they said, when I admitted to being able to do things well for a week or two at a time with enough caffeine and enough method changes. ""You need to stop using caffeine,"" they said, when doing so left me exhausted to the point of several weepy panic attacks until the migraine set in and wouldnt go away until I had at least 2 cups of coffee. Dont get me started on CBT and the ""I choose to be well today!"" philosophy that was beaten over my head at every opportunity.  All except one. I went on a frustrated rant about a year ago to my psych at the time about how none of these damn meds helped me with my focus and how I felt exhausted all the time and I cant even force myself to do things and basic chores made me suicidal with rage at myself. She nodded and said (to the effect of), ""Yeah, nope, thats  , heres some Strattera."" I proceeded to get a job, kept it for 3 months, cleaned up my shithole house, and lost a total of 70 pounds over a year, about half of what I needed to lose to be a healthy weight.  Then the Strattera stopped working. I had a ragey breakdown at work and never went back. To be fair, it was basic customer service in a call center, my third attempt, the first of which ended in me being fired for being hospitalized. I probably should have gathered that being on the phone all day with strangers is not a good job for me, but with my spotty job history and the cities I lived in at the time it was pretty much the only thing I qualified for. I started binge eating again. We seized an opportunity to get the fuck out of Texas.  That move, and the prospect of having to work in a call center *again* , hospitalized me for a second time.  After I got out of the hospital, however, I finally qualified for Arizona Medicaid. After a couple of months of being either too busy, too broke, or too mentally broken to pursue actual care, I did, and my current psychiatrist straight up told me she doesnt see bipolar disorder at all.  ,  , PTSD, depression? Yup, but bipolar was just not there. She started me on Vyvanse along with the light antipsychotic and the   medication I had from the hospital.   It feels like the first time I got glasses. Everything is clearer, sharper. Ive been on Vyvanse for four whole days and my house is clean for the first time since moving here. I have blown my eating and exercise goals out of the water. Ive totally reconsidered reapplying for disability and I want to go back to college.  My problem now is I have no money at all. Im not sure I even know how to work anymore. I now have another long 8 month gap in employment, lowering my employability even further than the 6+ jobs Ive lost due to my mental health, none of which I held longer than 6 months, most of which are less than 3 months. Im at risk of homelessness due to fuckery with my rental and insurance companies. I dont have any unexpired certs, degrees, or any sort of skills to sell myself on. I cant drive (not that I have a car). Ive spent the last 2 months before the new medication in bed crying when I wasnt oversleeping. Again due to the fuckery with my rental company, the clothes I have left barely fill a laundry basket and I have no makeup (I have acne scarring among other skin defects I need to cover up, goodbye self-esteem and the only art form I consistently appreciated). Just these past couple of months have wrought so much drama I cant begin to cover it here. My husband works, but he is struggling to do so and its still not enough to cover everything.  I dont have any bras and Ive been in supreme migraines, neck and shoulder pain for weeks because of it. This brings me to...  TL;DR: How do I start over at 23 and unemployable? How do I scrape together the shambles of my life to finally have a safe healthy home and enough money to live on?   I ask here because I hope some of you will understand my plight a little better. I live in Phoenix, AZ so I know there should be resources and stuff, I just have no idea in what order I should tackle all these very pressing matters that are demanding my time, attention, and money all at once. I can answer any questions you may have.  Bonus points for anyone with spicy tips and tricks on living with   and migraines or other chronic pain.

3701,sreiches,0.0,Interview experience has me down and in doubt,"Yesterday wasn’t great.  A week ago today, I started Adderall after going off medication back in high school (Ritalin at the time). It’s been almost two decades since then, but lately I’ve been feeling like I haven’t been living up to my potential and so I bit the bullet.  That first week was terrific. The difference between being on meds and off meds was stark. I was less irritable, more readily began tasks, and could maintain focus without having to constantly pull myself away from distractions (just a gentle tug at most). I didn’t go into an   spiral over my own worst-case assumptions.  Friday I interviewed for a part-time job. I work full-time, but want to get some supplementary income while I work on making a major career move (been applying to jobs daily for a few weeks). The interview went well, they seemed ready to bring me on right then and there. But their background check system was down, and I had to get back to my full-time, so they said they’d call when they’d worked it out worth next steps.  Yesterday, I woke up to a single sentence e-mail stating that they were not moving forward with me. It might be in error (I technically applied to multiple roles, and have heard of this happening to others who applied there before and did get jobs), but it didn’t feel great.   The timing was unfortunate; I had a phone interview in the afternoon with a non-profit for a role that would have been a big career step up, but I felt like I was on the defensive the whole interview, stumbling over my words (which usually isn’t an issue for me, especially while medicated). Ostensibly, I find out next week if I move forward to an in-person interview, but my confidence has been shaken, and I might be hyper-aware due to that, but I feel like all the positive effects of the meds have just dissipated.  I’m still moving forward, still applying, and I’m doing better today than I was yesterday, but I can’t help feeling a little more muted about it.

For instance, i have 3 hours to complete a (well defined) task and say the time is enough. But somehow, i dilate the task as if to fill in the time. Perfectionist mindset sets in (unconsciously) and i will add more elements than is required. Or ill think more. Or, my poor concentration will become even more poor and the sense of urgency is turned off.  If the time is just ok to finish, i will automatically think that this time is not enough, so whats the point in starting. And i dont start and leave it for other times.   Only time i get things done(though horribly at times) is when the dateline is external and theres absolutely no escape from the consequence. This is when i suddenly become more alert, suddenly i know what to do and whats not required. I stick to the necessity and leave out extra details. Concentration tries its hardest.  But the last scenario (external datelines) is not always available. I dont have anyone to hold me accountable (though i have searched hard for one, but no).  How to cope with this?

It’s stressful,   provoking, and all around not compatible with   (inattentive subtype).  I have to sit for long hours (14/day usually) to get done what my counterparts can get done in 8-10.  I have a few methods that work (When I stick to them)  1. MyNoise.net is a dream. I can block out otherwise distracting noises and calibrate the sounds to my mood 2. Meditation timer. I set it for an hour at a time with 20 min intervals. When the (calming) bell goes off I return to my breath for 15 seconds before getting back to my studies 3. Meidvate.com I set this one for 3 hrs at a time and have a 5 minute interval to make sure i’m aware of how much time is passing. If i don’t do this I end up getting too focused on one aspect of my studies and don’t cover the vast amounts of information I have to get through.  Wondering what else you’ve done to keep on track and improve your studies/work/life.  Hands down the thing that works best though is adequate sleep. I cut myself off from studying at 10 pm, but unfortunately I find myself on YouTube delaying sleep. Would be fine except for no matter what time I go to bed i’m Up by 6 am alarm clock or not.

She knows what shes talking about but I feel like this is an oddly specific situation.      I recently switched from Adderall to Vyvanse.

3727,theonlyrubbertree,0.0,Day 4 of meds! It's... interesting,"I know medication affects everyone differently but before I was prescribed I found it really useful to read about other peoples experiences with medication so I had some idea of what to expect, so I wanted to share mine. It would be good to hear if what Im experiencing matches or differs what other people have experienced! Also, I know its still super early days and things can and will change :)  **Meds are making me sleepy** first and foremost. Im not getting the best sleep, though, as I have five flatmates and they arent quiet. This isnt new, but feeling sleepy during the day is. **It starts about 30-60 minutes after I take my meds.** Its not unpleasant but its a little unexpected - I thought I would feel energised! **Perhaps I am just genuinely tired** and Im just not so jittery and anxious that I dont notice like I was before? I dont know. **Its definitely something Ill bring up with my psych at my next appointment.**  **My hands are really cold**. I have poor circulation at the best of times because of Hashimotos/autoimmune thyroiditis, which means I have alternating periods of hyper- and hypothyroidism. I am medicated for this and my latest blood test a month ago came back fine. I may not be eating enough or moving enough. It may just be because its cold where I live at the moment. It may be the meds. **Again, something to bring up with the psych.**  **Feeling a little spaced out.** I disassociate a little fairly often, which is usually triggered by  , being in a loud or overwhelming environment, or there being total cloud cover (dont ask me why, I dont get it either). I could be feeling this way because I would be feeling this way anyway, or the meds could be triggering it, its hard to know. It is a total-cloud-cover day.  **Feeling... quiet**. Usually inside my brain theres about seventeen different radio stations playing at once. There are random thoughts, things Im worried about, future problems Im trying to solve, one song playing over and over and over and over, and a whole load of sounds and sights coming in from the outside. My brain wants to try and listen to all these radio stations at once. **Today, I feel like I have just one radio turned on in my brain, and its up to me tune it. Whats more, once Ive tuned it in to a certain thought or stimulus, it stays tuned in until I decide to change it**. If something else catches my attention for a moment, I can easily go back to listening to it. This is mind-blowing, and Ill be honest, quite unnerving. **Its probably a good thing**, and its certainly relieving in a lot of ways, **but it feels so different to what Im used to that Im not comfortable with it yet.** The chaos was challenging but it was familiar.  **I dont care about eating so much**, but when I do eat Im ravenously hungry. I dont usually ever feel hungry; I just get irritable and stupid and then I know its time to eat. Im out of an eating routine because things have been so chaotic in the flat, and Im not as motivated to go and make food. This is fine and the psych warned me this might happen. **Im just going to be more strict about my food routine.**  **I sat through an entire film at the cinema last night** and didnt zone out once! I went to see Mary Queen of Scots (which I thought was fantastic btw) and I stayed focused the whole time. Usually when I watch a film Ill lose focus multiple times and have to manually pull myself back in. If Im watching something at home alone I rewind a lot when I realise Ive not been paying attention. I dont remember zoning out once last night. I didnt get fidgety. It was awesome.  **It seems easier to do things I want to do.** I bought a graphics tablet this year and got really excited about getting into pixel art but I couldnt sustain focus/interest long enough to finish my first project. Ive actually chipped away at it this weekend. **I didnt hyper-focus,** but I did a few hours over two days and stopped when I got tired. Ive also been teaching myself some maths on the Khan Academy website (shoutout to the redditor who suggested it in a post on here the other day!) and same thing, no hyper-focusing, but a few hours of work til I had something else I needed to do or I needed to take a break. **This could just be placebo/novelty,** but this is the part of treatment Im potentially most excited about. One of the most debilitating things is wanting to do something so much but not being able to make myself do it, unless I hyper-focus to the detriment of everything else. I am cautiously optimistic.  **It isnt any easier to do things I dont want to do!** Oh well, you cant win em all! I still havent made a dentists appointment and I keep forgetting to go pick up the second half of my prescription. Perhaps I will one day (any tips on getting this kind of shit done? I make lists and set alarms and then I ignore them).  **Im irritable**. But this could well be down to not eating enough, not sleeping enough, and living with far too many people. Plus someone ate my bread this morning and left me with only one crust for my breakfast which would piss anyone off. Hopefully moving into a place of my own later this year which will be heaven, and Ill have so much more control over my environment. Or the meds could be making me more irritable than usual. Its hard to tell.  **This is getting long so Ill stop here**. **No worries if you didnt read the whole thing or only skimmed it!** Ill bold some of the most pertinent bits for my fellow skimmers. **In conclusion: meds are weird and interesting but having noticeable effects**. Im looking forward to seeing how things progress and whether theyll help enable me, along with all the other things I know I need to do, to make some long-term, sustainable improvements to my life.",1553622432,1553622434,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b5ssfv/day_4_of_meds_its_interesting/,False,False,1.0

Slowly I just got more and more nervous and reluctant I’m busy areas   Now I’m a confident person generally, but for some reason I  just can not face driving anymore. The amount of things happening on the road seem to cause my brain the frazzle and I find it incredibly stressful. Parking is next level, I basically have an   meltdown in any parking scenario. So I’ve just quit driving. I get the train when I have a perfectly good car just sat on the driveway. It’s stupid, but I just can’t face it.

Id like to ask my doctor about taking it twice daily, however nothing online suggests this is do-able because of the lysine absorption rate and how its in your system for 24h.  **Question 2:** Are there any   medications I can take alongside Vyvanse, or is it time to look into an alternative?  **Question 3:** Does anyone have any general advice/tips.    **Context:**   Male, 25.  I have a medication follow up on Monday.  Im currently on 20mg of Vyanse and I love it. Ive been on it for around 3 months now. However the problem is that its only great for around 6 hours. But those 6 hours do wonders for me, the calming effects are incredible for my fairly severe anxieties. I understand that these six hours are essentially my peak time and the rest is more of a comedown.  Because of that, I wait till 11AM to take it to last me till 5PM to get through the work day. This results in a bad morning... every day. Scattered getting ready for work, wishing I was on my meds.  I attempted 30mg for a week or so, however I found I got ""speedy"" rather than calm during the peak and my negative side effects started to show.  I love 20mg because shortly after taking it, Im relaxed and focused. Im obviously not a work machine, but thats great, Im not getting ""speedy"".  The problem lies with the 6h of effects. Id love to be taking it at 7, but I cant deal with the after effects at 1PM, the last 4 hours of work are scatter brained and sluggish.  This also results in after 5PM being scatter brained and sluggish. I can barely focus on making dinner and dishes are an utter nightmare, yet during these 6h windows on the weekends, these tasks are a breeze.

First, I worked in a greenhouse for about  6 months and it was a hellish experience. I couldnt manage my time well enough to get all the plants watered in one day. (A congenital ankle issue also meant I was in constant pain from walking all day).   When I was mercifully let go from that job, I moved ""home"" and got a job as a porter for a car dealership. In less than a month, my absentmindedness and lack of talent for parking cars and trucks caused me to scratch/dent cars in 4 separate incidents. I was let go from this job as well.  Next, I worked in a grocery store deli. This was the only job I enjoyed any real success in. However, there was a lot of drama and one particularly draconian crew leader that I hate to this day. I was very glad to leave that position for the next one and will not be going back.  Finally, I was hired by a microbiology lab to prepare and analyze food samples. This was the best paying job Id ever had and I was very proud of it. However, I did not learn quickly enough and was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information I was expected to take in. The combination of the   this created and classic ADD absentmindedness meant I was making small but ultimately costly mistakes nearly constantly, especially as time went on. The combination of frequent mistakes and the fact that I just hadnt learned enough in my first 90 days lead them to let me go after about 100 days.  Now Im unemployed once again and have no idea where to turn. Im finally working on getting a grip on the ADD, so I guess thats something. Any advice or kind words are appreciated.

Why bring this to your attention?   I decided to contact a pharmacist in a Walgreens chat, and here was our conversation.  &gt;Pharmacist: Hi! My name is Candace A., Pharmacist. How can I help you?

I am a college student and already, the first day I took it (yesterday) I noticed how much calmer and clearer I was. I dont want to stay on anything that will, long term, be detrimental to my health.   **Pharmacist: The stimulants used to treat   are habit forming and potentially addictive. They should only be used at the lowest effective dose, for the shortest amount of time needed. For example, just on school days (avoided on weekends or school breaks).**   Visitor: Okay, so Im on 20mg. If I used it on my college days, Mon-Thurs, that would be safer than every day then if I were to stick with it long term? (I appreciate your clear response!)

3757,b0bby666,0.0,Can't do work and it's ruining my life,"Hello everyone, Im fairly new to Reddit and I dont know if this is the right place to post this but I really related to this subreddit so I guess this was the best place to come for advice.  First of all, I havent gotten diagnosed for   or ADD so I have never taken any meds but Im pretty sure I have some case of ADD. I am currently a senior in high school I have a huge problem with procrastination and getting things done and this is really affecting my life. Before I used to procrastinate but I got the work done just before the deadlines which was fine with me. But recently I procrastinate to the point where all my work is always late and once its late i never get around to doing it and it severely affects my grades in school. Any work I have including work for school, I always have a really hard time getting started on, and if I do start I constantly get distracted. This might be unrelated to ADD but also one of the reasons to my procrastinatation and not doing work is because I have a daily routine that has become a habit. My daily routine is i wake up a 6am for school. Come home from school at 3pm, eat and go on my phone for about 2 hours, take a nap, go to the gym at 7pm, eat again, then instead of doing work or something I waste time on my phone, play fortnite, or watch an nba game procrastinate doing work until 3 or 4am which them I get tired and then i go to sleep and wake back up at 6am for school. Ive been in this type of cycle all 4 years of high school and I seem to have a hard time breaking out of it. I realize this is a terrible habit but everytime I try to get my life back together and try to be productive it only last a few days.  Im sure this problem will end when I go to college next year (atleast I hope so) but currently Im really struggling with getting work done. Since Im already posting here, I also have another problem of constantly forgetting things. I began putting things into my calendar and I have a to do list which really help but minor tasks or chores I need to do or if someone tells me to do something and I dont write it down or set a reminder for it, I always end up forgetting which makes me look irresponsible.  I know this turned into a long post so thank you to whoever read and is able to help.

I feel like my mind is constantly making noises even when nothing is really there like I’ll keep a song on repeat or a conversation in my head for hours or sometimes It seems like I litterally focus on every single sound in the room even if it’s the smallest sound no one would notice. It drives me crazy sometimes, it keeps me up at night where I can’t sleep and I often zone out in class cause I’m focusing on every cough, pencil tap, and even the slight noise coming from the vent. My girlfriend is going to college for psychology and she believes I have   off of what she has studied and from seeing her own brother deal with it. I also feel like I’m constantly on an aderinline rush and my blood is always pumping and I wanna just run around and scream.   I hope some of this makes sense but I jsut want to know if this sounds similar to what y’all experience. I have never thought I had   because sometimes I can focus solely on one thing and not worry about anything else for hours. Like if I put ear buds in and start writing a paper for class I can work and not notice if there was two people fighting right next to me it’s like I just become super super focus on one thing and lose sight of everything around me.  But I just want to know what y’all think. I plan on moving out later this year so once I do imma try to go to a therapist and see if I can get help because these issues have also led me into depression like states sometimes because I feel like I screw things up cause I’ll rush through them or I don’t fully think about my actions and how they may affect people.

I went to a general check with my family doctor, I talked with my psychiatrist I even did ECG and it seems my heart is fine so it’s probably   / panic attacks.

And it doesn’t seem to decrease with time of use. Still really bad every time I take.   Could it be I’ll have to take anti   pills everyday as long as I’m on stimulants?

During February, I was out of school for two weeks for medical reasons and one of my professors was a complete jerk to me and said I had to withdraw because she didn’t care about why I had to miss class and she took 25 points off of my final grade for each day I missed class; mind you, this class has no course work, aside from reading the assigned book and showing up to class. My university can only do so much to negotiate her syllabus, but ultimately she can fail me if she wants to. I met with several different administrators and assistant directors of offices at my school, who advocate for students with medical situations and we’re still currently trying to figure out what my options are (right now, it’s looking like my best bet is medically withdrawing).  With doing all of this, I wasn’t able to see my therapist, who is the only person with the power to make appointments with my psychiatrist and every time he’s available, I have class. So, I have been without Vyvanse for three weeks now. The first week was spring break, so I didn’t need it. The second week, or last week, was horrendous. I forgot things left and right and started homework and got nothing done. I was tired by 2PM and my meltdowns were coming in strong. I got into a really bad argument with my SO and he doesn’t know entirely how not having my medication affects me, so he doesn’t really want to talk through text. My mom suggested that I ask my friends if I can buy some IR or XR Adderall (I was on both before Vyvanse) until I get my prescription.   Does anyone have any advice on how to emotionally cope and stay productive while not on medication? On some days, I somehow am still able to wake up at the same time as usual (5:30AM) and get my day started, but I don’t stay on task AT ALL. For example, I should be in the shower right now, but I’m still typing this and I’ve been on my phone, while the water is running, for 20 minutes.

3800,Lessa22,0.0,Fell off the wagon this month,"I was doing really well Jan-Feb, better than I ever have really. Work was getting more tolerable, therapy was consistent, meds dosage was at a great spot. I was taking my meds every day, losing weight, getting in some exercise (not enough but at least getting a couple of days a week) cooking some meals, keeping the house more on the clean side of life.      2 weeks ago I took my friends out of town for his birthday. Since all we were going to do was lay around the hotel room and eat out at nice restaurants I didnt take my pills. 4 days sans Adderall. I really underestimated how badly that long of a meds break would affect me. I tried to start taking them again but its been sporadic at best. Taken nothing the past 3 days.      Ive completely gone off the rails. Hard fought habits are dead. Binge eating plate after plate of food that Im picking up at fast food joints. Work is backsliding and my stats are dropping. My apartment looks like it belongs on a episode of hoarders and my fridge is full of expired food.      I managed to take my pill this morning but Im feeling so anxious about what I *havent* been doing and overwhelmed at the mess I have to clean up before I can start making forward momentum again that I feel frozen even with the meds.      It feels so shitty to have made all that progress and lose it all. It makes me question if its worth it to keep trying at all if its so easy to fall back into the weeds. I know I shouldnt think that way, we all struggle, Im just not not feeling very optimistic today.

3801,theonlyrubbertree,0.0,Day 4 of methylphenidate. Dose doubled from 5mg 3x a day to 10mg 3x a day,"I know medication affects everyone differently but before I was prescribed I found it really useful to read about other peoples experiences with medication so I had some idea of what to expect, so I wanted to share mine. It would be good to hear if what Im experiencing matches or differs what other people have experienced! Also, I know its still super early days and things can and will change :)  **Meds are making me sleepy** first and foremost. Im not getting the best sleep, though, as I have five flatmates and they arent quiet. This isnt new, but feeling sleepy during the day is. **It starts about 30-60 minutes after I take my meds.** Its not unpleasant but its a little unexpected - I thought I would feel energised! **Perhaps I am just genuinely tired** and Im just not so jittery and anxious that I dont notice like I was before? I dont know. **Its definitely something Ill bring up with my psych at my next appointment.**  **My hands are really cold**. I have poor circulation at the best of times because of Hashimotos/autoimmune thyroiditis, which means I have alternating periods of hyper- and hypothyroidism. I am medicated for this and my latest blood test a month ago came back fine. I may not be eating enough or moving enough. It may just be because its cold where I live at the moment. It may be the meds. **Again, something to bring up with the psych.**  **Feeling a little spaced out.** I disassociate a little fairly often, which is usually triggered by  , being in a loud or overwhelming environment, or there being total cloud cover (dont ask me why, I dont get it either). I could be feeling this way because I would be feeling this way anyway, or the meds could be triggering it, its hard to know. It is a total-cloud-cover day.  **Feeling... quiet**. Usually inside my brain theres about seventeen different radio stations playing at once. There are random thoughts, things Im worried about, future problems Im trying to solve, one song playing over and over and over and over, and a whole load of sounds and sights coming in from the outside. My brain wants to try and listen to all these radio stations at once. **Today, I feel like I have just one radio turned on in my brain, and its up to me tune it. Whats more, once Ive tuned it in to a certain thought or stimulus, it stays tuned in until I decide to change it**. If something else catches my attention for a moment, I can easily go back to listening to it. This is mind-blowing, and Ill be honest, quite unnerving. **Its probably a good thing**, and its certainly relieving in a lot of ways, **but it feels so different to what Im used to that Im not comfortable with it yet.** The chaos was challenging but it was familiar.   **I dont care about eating so much**, but when I do eat Im ravenously hungry. I dont usually ever feel hungry; I just get irritable and stupid and then I know its time to eat. Im out of an eating routine because things have been so chaotic in the flat, and Im not as motivated to go and make food. This is fine and the psych warned me this might happen. **Im just going to be more strict about my food routine.**  **I sat through an entire film at the cinema last night** and didnt zone out once! I went to see Mary Queen of Scots (which I thought was fantastic btw) and I stayed focused the whole time. Usually when I watch a film Ill lose focus multiple times and have to manually pull myself back in. If Im watching something at home alone I rewind a lot when I realise Ive not been paying attention. I dont remember zoning out once last night. I didnt get fidgety. It was awesome.  **It seems easier to do things I want to do.** I bought a graphics tablet this year and got really excited about getting into pixel art but I couldnt sustain focus/interest long enough to finish my first project. Ive actually chipped away at it this weekend. **I didnt hyperfocus,** but I did a few hours over two days and stopped when I got tired. Ive also been teaching myself some maths on the Khan Academy website (shoutout to the redditor who suggested it in a post on here the other day!) and same thing, no hyperfocusing, but a few hours of work til I had something else I needed to do or I needed to take a break. **This could just be placebo/novelty,** but this is the part of treatment Im potentially most excited about. One of the most debilitating things is wanting to do something so much but not being able to make myself do it, unless I hyperfocus to the detriment of everything else. I am cautiously optimistic.  **It isnt any easier to do things I dont want to do!** Oh well, you cant win em all! I still havent made a dentists appointment and I keep forgetting to go pick up the second half of my prescription. Perhaps I will one day (any tips on getting this kind of shit done? I make lists and set alarms and then I ignore them).  **Im irritable**. But this could well be down to not eating enough, not sleeping enough, and living with far too many people. Plus someone ate my bread this morning and left me with only one crust for my breakfast which would piss anyone off. Hopefully moving into a place of my own later this year which will be heaven, and Ill have so much more control over my environment. Or the meds could be making me more irritable than usual. Its hard to tell.  **This is getting long so Ill stop here**. **No worries if you didnt read the whole thing or only skimmed it!** Ill bold some of the most pertinent bits for my fellow skimmers. **In conclusion: meds are weird and interesting but having noticeable effects**. Im looking forward to seeing how things progress and whether theyll help enable me, along with all the other things I know I need to do, to make some long-term, sustainable improvements to my life.",1553606354,1553606355,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b5pm58/day_4_of_methylphenidate_dose_doubled_from_5mg_3x/,False,False,1.0

3806,Heathbar08,0.0,Any Advice for a Future in ADHD Research?,"    TL;DR: I have developed a deep desire to revolutionize the way we treat and diagnose   as a result of growing up with   and family members with  . Currently in my junior year of college, my once clear path has become clouded and I am seeking guidance and advice from anyone willing to help. The first two paragraphs include some background information about myself and the third paragraph describes my situation in more detail.       Diagnosed with   at the age of 5, I am the oldest of three and am well acquainted with the struggles associated with growing up with siblings and parents with mental disorders. From the stress placed on a family when a members medication isnt working properly to the financial burdens of doctors appointments and prescriptions, I, along with my family, have been through what, at times, felt like hell and back. It was through these tribulations and hardships that I developed a passionate desire to make lasting and impacting contributions to the ways we treat and diagnose   in children and adolescents. Through my efforts, I hope to mitigate the struggles and associated pains and stresses of living with   experienced by those in future generations.      I am currently a junior in college working towards a degree in bioengineering with a focus in biopharmaceutical engineering. Apart from being fascinated by the subject, I originally chose this major because I wanted to develop a better understanding of drugs while also developing the problem-solving mindset of an engineer before tackling medical school. All of this was in hopes of one day becoming a child psychiatrist. I was dead set on eliminating the widespread trial-and-error system currently employed by psychiatrists to decide which medications to prescribe. Growing up, the process appeared to be an unnecessarily long and arduous guessing game, taking months to years in the extreme cases for my siblings, my mother, and myself to find a ""cocktail"" that both works and does not adversely interact with other medications we were prescribed. Throughout the entire process, whichever member was subject to this burdensome system was subject to unnecessary impairments with little to no certainty whether an end was in sight. This process, along with other issues including improper diagnoses and pill pushing, made me wonder if I could make a change for the better. It was not until I witnessed and the negative impacts on my siblings abilities to pursue an education and have social lives, and years of comforting a depressed mother and empathizing with a frustrated father that sparked my strong desire to work as hard as I could towards this goal.     This is where I was hoping I could get some help from the community as I feel this community would be the best place to find a wealth of knowledge because I dont know where to look anymore.  I dropped the idea of becoming a child psychiatrist halfway through my sophomore year. I realized I did not want to work behind a desk all day, rather I want to work in a lab/research environment. After that decision, I clung to the idea of pursuing a PHD at a university conducting relevant research, but lately I have been doubting if that is my best approach. I love all the science courses I have taken and there are so many avenues and interests that appeal to me. Neurology, biopharmaceutical engineering, medicine, and cognitive neuroscience are fields that greatly interest me, but to choose one over the other leaves me with the fear that I may limit myself too much. Developing a device that can aid in the diagnosis of  , further researching the underlying mechanisms responsible for   in the brain and rest of the body, and developing treatments for   in children are all things that I would dedicate my life to pursuing without hesitation. Any thoughts and/or advice will be greatly appreciated. ",1553603923,1553603925,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b5p6t1/any_advice_for_a_future_in_adhd_research/,False,False,1.0

3822,MasterCrastinator,0.0,Am I wrong?,"Important: in this post I ONLY want to share my experience, and I am STRICTLY not asking for any diagnosis.   What I am asking is if anyone has had a similar experience.  So here goes.  Up until puberty I was a good student. I had high grades, roughly top of my class you could say in most subjects / classes. I did not have to study very much to achieve this. Tests I would study the day before. Other homework I and my friends would try and finish as fast as possible after it was assigned (yes we were hardcore nerds).   Puberty was a bad time. I will be the first to admit it. Lots of changes, mostly negative ones.    Since then, I have also struggled academically. Very severely at times, failed a year. Felt very very incompetent because of this. I was also severely (socially) anxious around age 16-20ish.    Around 19 I went to college / university. I initially liked it, but I couldnt keep up with the heavy course load (this was engineering). 3 years went by in which I tried to motivate myself by putting intense pressure on myself (psychologically) which did not work. My procrastination went to absolutely absurd levels, I am pretty sure I am worse than anyone else on this planet. This of course was followed by extremely intense self hatred (really cannot be understated) and all the rest. For the longest time, I believed I perfectly fit the picture of a person with   and depression. However, it is only after learning about ADD /   in adults, around age 25.5, that I really feel I fit that picture. I am someone with fairly high IQ, so early in life it was never a problem. I used to rush homework also together with my friends as quickly as possible, to get it out the way as fast as we could. This was a sport pretty much. Primary / elementary school was never an issue because we did not have homework lol.   After learning about adult   my depression and particularly self hate / self shame guilt etc. reduced vastly. I finally found something that made sense. However, they could not diagnose me as I did not show enough symptoms in childhood. I show clinically enough symptoms now. It is severely negatively impacting my life, I had to stop with my engineering degree 3 years ago because I could not do it (logical if you really had ADD right?), because the course load completely overwhelmed me. I had tried all behavorial techniques, nothing worked.  I have enough energy to go to the gym, do other fun stuff even today. Thinking about my past / my life and what could have been gets me extremely depressed (isnt that logical???). But you see, I am not intrinisically depressed. I find enjoyment in things that do not remind me of my past or things I struggle with if that makes sense. I do not have any of the physical symptoms of depression currently. Not to sound like some self pitying fool, but nobody at the moment really wants to believe me, as I did not get the diagnosis.   It is ironic because I used to think the same way (as the doctors, my parents, all people now who say I do not have it) before I really properly understood what ADD was. Am I fooling myself or what is going on here?   I am extremely reluctant to take an SSRI which I have been given as I do not believe it will help me. In the past it would have made more sense, particularly for   but I do not believe I suffer from   or depression anymore at the root.",1553596939,1553596940,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b5o47g/am_i_wrong/,False,False,1.0

3825,enternationalist,0.0,Calendaring/Scheduling Strategies Part II,"Hello everyone! This seems to one of the few personal things Ive been able to stick with longer than a week, so Im going to keep the ball rolling (if only for myself).  See the previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ /comments/b35eyc/calendarsschedule_lets_figure_out_how_to_optimise/  Ive arrived at some new ideas as a result of the short discussion last time, so Im here to try it again.  At the moment, Im trialling a new day-to day method. Im sure most of you use or have used a Pomodoro or similar method before. If youre not familiar, the principle of the Pomodoro method is something like:   * Break down your work into consistent blocks that are easy for your brain to commit to doing. Traditionally, these blocks are about 25 minutes long and followed by a 5 minute break. This is about right for me, but varies.   * Because its easy to break almost any work down into these small blocks (""Pomodoros"" in the traditional method), even major tasks can be made into digestible parts. (e.g. thinking about doing a block a day learning to play an instrument is a lot less overwhelming than thinking about all the things you need to do to learn an instrument)  Theres a bit more to it, but thats the gist. **More importantly**, Ive found my brain works with these ""pomodoros"" a lot more readily than days, or hours. If I guess how long something will take in hours or days, Im invariably off - but its easy to say how many ""pomodoros"" or chunks it will take. What I cant consistently say (yet) is how many chunks I can do in a week - i.e., how consistently I work over a week, and how much unplanned stuff will come up.  So, Ive come up with a framework to try and catch that. Instead of organising my day by the hour, Ive blocked it into ""pomodoros""/chunks. Critically, Ive divided it into planned and unplanned chunks. In my case, I am working with 8 planned chunks and 4 unplanned chunks in a day. At the start of the day, I fill in the 8 planned chunks with my to-do list, and anything urgent that comes up goes into the 4. Once the 4 unplanned chunks are full, I know I cant accept any more work for the day.   Basically, that means I plan that 2 hours of my work day will be stuff I didnt foresee, or will be taken up by meetings or discussions.  Once Ive run with this for a while, I plan to attempt to integrate this into a calendar operating on the same basis, in attempt to realistically manage my workload. With some due dates, dependencies and importance rankings, this would also be computationally simple to optimise into a schedule (for the nerds out there who love to automate).  Has anyone else tried manipulating scheduling systems to take advantage of their own brain and have feedback, or any other ideas?  **TL;DR**  * Pomodoros are useful for getting a start on things  * Ive found my brain better predicts its use of time in terms of pomodoros rather than hours/days/weeks, and suspect this will be similar for others  * I hypothesise scheduling the day in terms of these chunks with allowance for unplanned work will help limit overcommitting to too many things, as well as conceptualising how much effort and time tasks actually take.  * I further suspect this could be well applied to a long-term schedule, but have not committed to trying it",1553594700,1553594700,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b5ntwy/calendaringscheduling_strategies_part_ii/,False,False,1.0

I hadn’t even an inkling as to the multitude of ways this disorder had, was, and is affecting me. I just didn’t know, I didn’t think to look - just assumed maybe everyone right. Maybe my diagnosis was just the fancy label they slap on everything nowadays. Maybe I was just incompetent, just a bad kid.   It wasn’t until I left a recent relationship that a lightbulb went off. Perhaps my   *was* a problem. I mean come on! The time blindness, the forgetfulness, the self-doubt, the belief that I was stupid- it was all starting to make sense!

Im the proud owner of a small business (creative and traditional dog grooming). Im almost 4.5 years into my business, but have 13 years in my field. I am a single mother, with a 10 year old son and a 4 year old daughter. We have been car-free for 5 years and cycle or Uber wherever we need to be.  February 2017, my partner of 6 years told me his mother had tried to commit suicide. 2 days after he left to be with her, I discovered he had actually left the country with his ex on a 2 week vacation to Ireland and England.  It destroyed me. But I had a business to run, and it was in the middle of a gorgeous shop makeover that my dad and I were doing ourselves. It took 2 months to finish. I was broken. When he returned, I was so emotionally and physically overwrought that 2 days later, I came down with a massive fever and bronchitis, which took my voice for 2 months. Later, I learned he had been secretly using heroin for over a year. The next year and a half was a humiliating experience in which i tried to save a man intent on self destruction, while running a business and raising two children. I left that relationship Christmas of 2017.  I am well aware of my habits, pitfalls, limitations. I am creative, passionate, but incredibly disorganized, enormous difficulty with book keeping, and house keeping. My mother, who answered phones and paid the bills, began havimg massive health issues. I was forced to let her go after 6 months of clients complaining about having a hard time setting appointments via phone. My mom was quite ill and either sleeping or at the doctor, but hid it from me.  In fall of 2018, I sought counselling. I was  diagnosed with Adult ADD and referred to a mental health place, where I was prescribed zoloft and adderall.  Once we got tbe dosage correct, It was like blinders were put on. I could focus on the ""boring part"" of running a business: writing apts in a book, record keeping, ordering shampoo. I could clean house at least once a week. I could focus.  My mom passed away in January of this year. I lost my mom, the one person i admired and looked up to and called about household matters (how to get blood out of denim, why bleach was destroying my lights, how to balance work, cooking dinner, dishes, my sons weird math homework, teaching my kids to be somewhat organized, etc). I still see my counselor. But last monday, I was informed that my psych left the practice. And they were being audited and couldnt prescribe my meds because the head psych in Reno ""hates adderall"". I get the feeling the doctor i saw is the one who doesnt like adderall.  I was switched to Wellbutrin and Straterra. Im tired all the time, nauseus, and irritable as hell. I feel lazy. Useless. Deficient. I keep waking up at midnight, then I cant sleep. Today was the day my daughter and I usually plant all kinds of veggies, I got through half, then lost myself googling how to roto-till and plant grass, different grass types, whether I can grow mint as ground cover, etc. This is my usual order of operations, before I got here I had to ride my bike to my shop to get my new meds, which Id left in my purse with my keys. Thank god id forgotten to lock the back door to get in.  Im messing up, Im not getting my stuff done. Im failing as a mother, as a business owner, as my mothers daughter.

In the middle of reading it, I was immediately reminded of a post on here from a few weeks ago about a PhD student (Ill edit this space with the link sometime tomorrow (maybe (you know how it goes))) who had just learned that one of the symptoms of   is an inability to regulate our emotions. Let me tell you the synthesis of these two pieces of information nearly broke me.  For the past month or so I have gotten into a routine of chronic procrastination of the worst kind.  Every morning after dropping my girlfriend off at work, I would immediately come home, sit on the toilet (because Im super regular (sorry for tmi)), bust out my phone, and end up wasting a good 3-5 hours just sitting there checking emails, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, Tumblr, webcomics, webnovels, blogs, and whatever other rabbit holes I happened to end up in that day.  I would tell myself ""at least youre kind of productive saving job postings for later and checking your email, and if you didnt keep up with all your stories they would get backed up so badly you might never catch up.""  But this was a small comfort compared to nearly missing homework assignments for my grad school classes, or putting off working on extremely important projects until almost past the last minute.  The guilt grew daily, but I couldnt see a way to break the habitual ritual.  ... Until I read this article.  As soon as it said that to break the cycle of procrastination you have to be willing to FORGIVE yourself for the procrastinations of the past, I immediately burst into tears, and it was only the barest of margins that kept me from wailing out loud enough to wake up my SO just now at 1:30 AM CST.  I can not tell you the elation, the relief of some of my burden lifted, the sadness at so much wasted time that could have so easily been limited if I had only known what I needed to do, but I guess ""If your home is on fire, you cant put it out from inside the house.""  The discovery that procrastination is an emotional problem + trouble regulating emotions being a major symptom of   = a potential avenue for more targeted treatment plans!

My brother &amp; I have both been diagnosed with   and have both exhibited MAJOR symptoms our entire lives. My brother was diagnosed at 6 years old, I was diagnosed today, at 22. I started to show symptoms while my parents were preoccupied with the heat of his diagnosis and completely neglected me as child, teenager and young adult. I would get yelled out for doing the things my brother got a pass on. They never once took my to the doctor or even questioned if I had any kind of  , depression, or  . I was extremely smart and my brother is below average intelligence, because of this, they just thought I was being lazy. I had to get a job at 16 (and have worked ever since) &amp; also kept up with clubs and 3 sports. My brother hasnt worked a day in his life and is 19, my parents say its because of football... I had to pay my own rent, books &amp; everything but tuition in college while also being the president of a club and being a full time athlete (D1 Club Rowing).  My parents are now providing everything for him, financially, even taking out a private loan (something they absolutely refused to do for me) just so he can sit the bench his first 3 years at a D1 school.   Anyways, I have been misdiagnosed for 2 years, with GAD. No SSRI has worked for me, it only made me extremely depressed and added to my problems.   I have recently talked to other family members who have noticed how differently my parents treat me compared to my brother. Today, my therapist was completely confused as to how my brother was diagnosed so young but Ive gone this long without. To hear this from a psychologist &amp; my family members is just so validating but also really sucks because now, at 22, I have to come to terms with the fact that my parents really have not given a single shit about me my entire life.

Debating over possible meds route","Hello all, this will probably get wordy, so I apologize in advance.   My son is 7 and has struggled with one thing or another since he was born. Notably, at 3 he was diagnosed with a speech delay, developmental delay, and SPD. After a year of special pre-k, speech, and OT therapy, he was caught up developmentally. We then moved and our new state didn’t agree with his previous IEP and his new pediatrician didn’t agree with an SPD diagnosis. At 4, he was in regular pre-k plus speech therapy and his new developmental ped said   and recommended we try behavior therapy. We did 6 months of BT where his behavior was much worse forcing him to go to the appts and the therapist wanted to discuss his diet more than anything else. I finally discontinued the appts. Since then he has still been receiving speech in school and works with a behavior aide in school. Behavior wise, he has been getting better as the years progress. We went from once + weekly phone calls from the principal in K, to 1-2 a month in 1st and so far this school year (2nd) he has only had 1 call. His teachers have all been amazing with working with what works for him. He always sits in the back of the classroom, is allowed to stand/pace around his area as long as he’s not disrupting anyone else. He does very well in all math related work but struggles with writing work. His teacher has found ways to help him, including a checklist of what she expects so he knows. And it’s helping. But I worry that we will eventually run into a teacher that refuses to work with him. He still struggles with some SPD symptoms and I’ve brought it up with his primary pediatrician. She sent him for OT over the summer, which helped his hand writing a bit, but when I asked the school OT to evaluate him, he was deemed not needing help.  I started him in karate at the beginning of the school year after reading that it could help kids with  . He enjoys it if it’s a good day. Bad days, he gets mad at me and everyone bc he was in trouble. It is so hard to watch him in class and see his brain struggle to focus on something unless he has an adults full attention. Then he thrives. His Master says he’s seen worse   cases and to just have him keep at it. But he said something to me that’s stuck with me... ‘it’s ok, this time of day the meds are wearing off’. Only he’s not on meds. Master seemed pretty surprised he isn’t.   So I’ve been questioning if he should be. Would he struggle in writing less if he were? Would he have less behavior issues if he were? We have recently cut back electronic time for all kids and he is really struggling. He is mad and yells more. I don’t want to medicate him just to do it. I don’t know if these issues are enough for medication. His drs keep stopping when they hear he can focus in school.   I know no one is going to have yes/no answer to this because it is a personal decision. I guess I’m just looking for some experience/guidance from people who were in similar situations.

No matter how early I wake up or how late my first appointment is, I’ve always struggled to leave on time because I get so distracted while i’m trying to get ready.   The first thing I do when my alarm goes off is turn my bedside light on so it’s harder for me to fall back asleep. I have multiple alarms set just in case too but in the past this didn’t work that well. And when I wake up I’ll play some upbeat music too, as it helps my brain wake up.   While i’m getting ready — showering, putting on makeup, getting dressed — I listen to a podcast or more music. This helps me stay on task because it keeps my brain busy thinking about whatever i’m listening to, removing the temptation for me to end up scrolling endlessly through my phone for that next dopamine hit.   That’s really it! It’s super simple and it’s changed my productivity dramatically just in time to start my first full time job.

3909,_Simurgh_,0.0,"Adderall, Welbutrin, and Strange Sleep Patterns?","I changed my medications around about 2 weeks ago, and since then my level of functioning has been abysmal.  For context, I have been dealing with a neurological disorder called POTS, which causes severe fatigue and brain fog, and depression/  for several years. The two dont mesh well together and aggregate each others symptoms. Its varied significantly in severity but has been mostly under control for the past year.   About 6 months ago I went out of my way to get an   diagnosis that, in hindsight, should have been noticed in like elementary school. Getting on Adderall for the first time was amazing, I actually felt like a regular person, and was only limited by the hours in the day, not how much energy I had to do things. For context on how bad it was, the visual attention portion of the diagnosis testing has an average score of about 75, mine was a 2.  So my ongoing medications for those six months were 20mg Celexa, 150mg Welbutrin, and 25mg Adderall XR, and it was a good combo. Not perfect, but fairly effective. My main complaint on these meds was that I tended to need a lot of sleep, would have difficulty waking up, and felt very fatigued, especially in the evenings when the Adderall wore off.   When I went to my psychologist to try and deal with these, he upped my dosage of Welbutrin to 300mg, and gave me a second afternoon dose of 25mg Adderall XR. This is when the problems started.  I dont know how, but doubling the dose of a stimulant and an anti-depressant without fatigue side effects made me WAY more tired. I have been missing classes because I will go to bed at 11pm and uncontrollably sleep for 12+ hours in a single sitting on a regular basis. In the afternoon I will get these almost irresistible urges to fall asleep, not bad enough to pass out, but enough to drop whatever Im doing and go to bed and nap for 3+ hours. I will try and wake up early for my 9am class and take my meds at 7am, but often I just fall back asleep, even with the Adderall! Ive tried adding caffeine pills to that morning dosage and no luck either. It almost feels like I am getting more restful sleep on the stimulants than during the night. It is likely not POTS related, as that is accompanied by lightheadedness and dizzyness, and symptoms are less severe when lying down.   My current theories are either an uncontrolled worsening of depressive symptoms, undiagnosed non-cataplexic narcolepsy, or some unknown drug interaction. I am going to schedule an appointment with my psychologist tomorrow, but for now does anyone on here know what on earth might be going on?",1553560010,1553560011,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b5isyu/adderall_welbutrin_and_strange_sleep_patterns/,False,False,1.0

While I’m finally able to focus and sit down and work on stuff without getting distracted, even with medicine **i often feel overwhelmed by the *amount* of things i need to do.** I’ve tried using a daily planner, but I’ve even had trouble consistently using it everyday because **my brain always thinks that something else is more important at the moment** than taking a moment and writing down what i need to do each day.   I’m frustrated because I’ve set all these goals in my head for what i want and what i envision a good day to be, but even with my medicine **it feels like there’s just not enough time to do everything that i want to.** I want to exercise more (still haven’t started), i want to make great grades, i want to have a flourishing social life, etc...

I even sometimes feel like eating a meal or getting a drink of water can be a burden. Like “Ugh, i have to make sure i eat something but that’s gonna take TIME”   When I’m on medicine I don’t feel like I have *nearly* enough time in the day to do what i want to, but when I’m *off* medicine I feel like i have all the time in the world to achieve my daily goals until its the end of the day and I’ve gotten absolutely nothing done.   *Can anybody relate, and if so do you have any advice?

Im sick of feeling so smart and so stupid at the same time, my lack of focus feeding the part of me thats sick of caring so much about classes I have to work so hard to do good in but I so badly want to want to care again about getting good grades.  Im sick of feeling like theres not enough time but wanting to jump straight to the finish line.  Im sick of not liking the positions Ive put myself in (I stopped exercising a long while ago, put on a lot of weight, and am only just getting back into it) and it always taking so long to get myself out.  Im sick of being sure of what I really think of people unless theyre in front of me.  Im sick of not being able to let go and yet somehow forgetting all the time.  Im sick of leaning so much on a friend, yet knowing I need to stand on my own feet and not feeling able too.  Im sick of always being in crisis mode where I feel like everythings going wrong but then taking a look and realizing it shouldnt be that bad and not knowing why Im feeling like it is.  Im sick of feeling like I have to always keep my emotions at a 5 even when Im feeling them at an 11 because ""guys dont cry"" and having this idea so deeply ingrained in me that when Im alone and feel like it, I cant.  Im sick who I was and how it perpetuates who I am. I want to slash and burn this facade, but maybe I should just leave it and my home behind (which tbh, isnt asking as much as youd think from me).

Im sick of that feeling most of all....  I want to be positive again. I want to feel stable again. I want to date without feeling like Im not good enough.

3942,only_popular,0.0,The difference between lazy procrastination and ADHD procrastination,"I posted this in a comment and a lot of people seemed to find it helpful, so I thought I’d report here. Editing the wording a bit to make it more readable!  **How can you tell the difference between laziness and  ?**   Do you *want* to do it? Do you find yourself starting, and then stopping, over and over again? Do you find yourself getting all your materials out, only to spend an hour dicking around? Do you find yourself getting up constantly to start other tasks while you’re in the middle of working? Do you spend all day anxiously thinking about the task, avoiding any “fun” activities, and instead spending the day in an anxious paralysis? If yes, it’s procrastination due to  .   Non-  procrastination (laziness) is me saying “I’m just not doing it (right now).” It means I’m out enjoying my life. I’m putting off my work until the last minute because I just don’t care about it. I’ll spend my night playing video games or spending time with my SO, and then wake up early to do my homework. The work is not a stressor. It’s not a priority.   With   procrastination (“I *keep-not-doing* it”) is when  I spend all day thinking about the task. I’ll get all my stuff out and then get distracted with other things. I’ll sit at my kitchen table for hours, doing nothing (or un-fun things), avoiding the work. I’ll forgo fun activities (turn down invitations, not go out with friends, not spend time with my SO) because I “need to get some work done,” only to find I’ve done nothing all day. I’ll start and then stop and then start and then stop my work over and over. The house will be scattered with unfinished homework, projects, and tasks I’ve forgotten about or accidentally abandoned, saying “oh, I’ll get back to that right after I do this...”    procrastination a cycle of me not doing my work despite my best efforts to do so. It feels guilty. It’s frustrating. I’ll have spent all day thinking about my work and trying to do it, not having any fun, and ending up with no progress. I’ll turn down invitations to hang out with friends. When they ask me how the project is going, I feel humiliated admitting that I’ve gotten nothing done, even though I said I was going to work on it while they went out without me.   Laziness does not feel guilty. I just don’t care about the task. I go out and enjoy my life and barely think about the task beyond a passing thought of “I should probably get started on that...”  When I was in high school, this is what my   procrastination looked like:   I’d spend all Saturday doing homework on and off, feeling anxious and paralyzed, and stay inside all day while my friends were out having fun. I was not having fun. I felt like a prisoner to my own homework. I kept sitting down to do my homework but always got distracted. My mind kept wandering off during the reading. It would take me 2-3 hours to read one history chapter, and I knew I’d go into class and fail the quiz (yet again). When my parents got home and asked you about my homework, I’d have to admit I didn’t get much done. Then I’d hear what I’d heard a million times before: “but you had all day!” Sometimes it even meant I couldn’t go to the party with my friends like I wanted to. Then the cycle continues, weekend after weekend, and I felt like I was drowning in work other people got done in 1/4th the time.   It didn’t get easier as an adult, either. I spent years feeling like a faker, I got good grades and people would tell me I’m smart. If they only knew how much I struggled, they’d take it back immediately. Graduation and receiving awards made me feel sick to my stomach. It felt like I was lying to these people.   **Tl;dr:**   procrastination is a cycle of anxious, frustrating, hugely effortful attempts and failures to begin and finish work that is important to you. Laziness is putting off unwanted tasks and enjoying life in the meantime.   I hope this helps people figure out the difference :)",1553550052,1553550053,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b5gure/the_difference_between_lazy_procrastination_and/,False,False,1.0

People sometimes try and help too, which I appreciate, but then they tell me I need to buckle down and work Im school- the very place that I have a majority of my   attacks, and where my parents, and society as a whole tell me I need to be in order to find meaningful success and a passport to a steady income. This always seems too daunting to process and I begin to pannick, just as I am now thinking of it. Im not saying my life is the worst, that Ive experienced the worst atrocities at the hands of teachers, but being different your whole life in such a subtle way that teachers are cautious of you and you cant relate to your peers, family etc was hard and not many can give you meaningful or helpful advice, which in particular is really wearing me down.   Counciling has just only really offered short term relief at times because overall, Im still feeling really lost and helpless. I dont really know what my specific talents are, and I have a tendency to overthink alot, leading me to even forget what my initial interests and passions were before I really fell off this year in terms of depression. I really have no idea what Im going to do at university here in Ireland, or even in general in life, and while apparently this feeling is normal for a 19 year old, all my friends have better ideas of themselves, their goals and seem to be better equipped to dealing with life due to my many unresolved  childhood and teen emotional traumas that have really left me a bit emotionally damaged  and riddled with insecurities.   Its like Im on a long treadmill, theres no way of getting off at the sides, and theres also a great pit leading to the unknown if you fall off, the stop button is 10 feet in front of me, and every time I get a little closer to slamming the stop button to catch my breath, the speed starts increasing exponentially. In this analogy Id say my cardiovascular fitness could be compared to my emotional maturity- not great, and I can feel my legs giving out soon, just asking you fellow runners here for any tips or Ill even settle for comfort in knowing if this is quite normal or not.  I just feel really lost and needed to put this all down somewhere so its not just bouncing around in my skull and causing me daily worry, and  if it helps anyone feel less alone in their struggle then cool, I like the idea of being more open so less people feel alone, bc I know this subredďit makes me feel a little less alone sometimes.

3949,AbukhdeirProductions,0.0,How can I improve this “in a hurry” feeling and not worry about the time running out.,"I knew since elementary school that there was something wrong. I always lacked proper focus. I thought it was my own fault and that I was just not putting in enough effort. Yawning throughout the entire day even with a full nights rest and an easy week. It wasn’t until recently when I was in a much more demanding job with a lot more responsibility that it finally drove me to see a psychologist and after a 10 minutes she was perplexed as to how I hadn’t already been diagnosed years before. Two weeks later I started 10mg IR Adderal, I took it for a month and it wasn’t what I thought it was gonna be. It made me tired and didn’t help with keeping me focused. I tried eliminating certain things, kept a log in a journal, took the right vitamins, stayed hidrated, ate right and slept well but in the end I was really trying hard to “make” it work because I wanted to avoid what everyone says is the inevitable “trial and error” until you find the right medicine. Now I’m on concerta 18mg, I think it’s generic. For the first time in my life I can narrow my focus. The appetite suppression is less than with Adderall but Jesus Christ there’s this damn feeling I have all the time like something’s missing. Like some appetite that can’t be satisfied with nicotine or anything. I’m seeking advice on a couple particular things since I know each persons brain and   is different. My problem is that I cannot for the life of me complete tasks. It’s definitely better since I’ve started concerta but I’m talking about a relentless UNWILLINGNESS to actually follow through with shit. It affects my entire life. Instead of setting the key TWO FEET AWAY ON THE HOOK I keep it in my jacket pocket. Imagine that two seconds of laziness but applied to everything. Anytime i get into my car it’s a 8/10 chance I left something inside. Basically I feel like AMPED to do something but then I’m doing it and I’m like not willing to put in the effort I guess. I’ve noticed too that with medication I’m a bit more agitated and quick to pull the trigger. For instance I can’t fucking stand the sound of people chewing food. Pre-concerta I’d be on the phone with someone and they’re chewing and I literally have to put the phone away from my ear and physically I can feel it nagging me like forks on a plate. With concerta I’m on the phone with my dad and he’s eating sunflower seeds and I literally hung up the phone because it was so impossible. I may be a bit over dramatic but each person has their things that just make their teeth clench and that’s mine. I’m trying to remain calm and not be as anxious but I’m always anxious and since taking the medication I definitely feel that overall my life has improved but my inability to complete something affects my life. I think I’m a love addict or whatever, I’m sick.

Backing up: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD in 2007. Been taking Lamictal and Wellbutrin all these years and I’ve mostly been okay—no suicidal ideation and virtually no mania. But something was still so off. I haven’t drank in 1.5 years either. I was both surprised and not when I got the   dx. Greeeaaaat. One more thing to add to the list. I was actually kind of incredulous, too.   Nonetheless, I made an appointment with my pdoc thinking he’d tell me the dx was incorrect but lo and behold, he said “yup, let’s start treatment with meds.” I felt relieved. Why did I feel so defensive about it? It’s probably the drug aspect. He prescribed Adderall 10mg twice a day on week days and once on Saturday. It was spring break for me so I’ve only been taking it in the AM, but today was my first day back to work and I took one pill at 7am and one at 12pm. I feel nothing. And I’ve felt nothing since I’ve been taking just one pill a day since last Wednesday. When will this kick in? I’m used to the slow-to-start meds, but this isn’t one so I’m just confused.

For the first time in my life I feel like a normal human being.  I was recently put on an SSRI to help with some mild depression, and mood stabilization.  I also started talking adderall again as an adult. Last time I took it was in college. But I have always hated the way it made me feel, how moody and transactional I was and how nauseous it made me. It also really made me super like gaggy ( if that’s a word) because the dry mouth was so bad I would like choke a lot on the dryness in my throat, this would consequently make me not really want to drink water and the side effects of nausea headache, moodiness, and weak feeling limbs and legs would get worse.   What I do now is I take my Prozac and Adderall in the morning and immediately drink a 1/4 to 1/2 gallon of water and it doesn’t feel awful and I don’t feel moody.  Also just training my self to constantly stay hydrated has helped so many other parts of my life.  I’m currently taking depending on need 40-60 mg or IR per day just depending on how I’m feeling. I have been on many ads meds and adderall was the least nauseating.  I remember the worst feeling drug was the XR but I’m going to talk to my psychiatrist about getting a script for XR and still keeping some IRS for short days or after work if I still need to be medicated for whatever reason. This is how it was prescribed to me before.  But I’m so glad with this new found knowledge of drinking a bunch of water before it feels like I can’t and I start to decompensate from the side effects.  I wish I would have known this trick when I was in school because I would not have hated taking it as much and I would have potentially done much better in my whole life.  If you guys have any other advice, tips success stories or things I should explore I would love to know your experience and how you’ve found what works for you because it may work for me as well.   I will be going back to school next year and I’m hoping I can find a way to get health insurance so I can stay feeling normal. Through nursing school.   Anyways that’s my short story hope you guys have found success as well!  TL;DR  I found a way to finally take my adderall so I can tolerate it and my prozac is helping also.

I’m currently in college and I’ve had a serious lack of focusing on my school work and being motivated. I would say I fought attention issues throughout my school years, but my grades were fine so I never completely believed I could have it.  I’m constantly anxious in public places or when I’m around people. My body feels that it can never be calm unless I’m by myself. When I’m doing reading(such as reading the news or articles) I can get through them without skipping if they interest me; however when it comes to assignments for school that aren’t particularly interesting, it will take me longer than usual to complete it.  I also make careless mistakes. If I’m working on an assignment, I’ll tend to put all effort in the beginning, but towards the end I know that I’ll make small errors w/o caring about them.  My mind is constantly all over the place, and is generally off topic to what I may be doing at that moment. Parts of a song will go through my head, fantasizing about things that haven’t occurred, or thinking about whatever may be on my mind.   I use to believe these things were a norm but it’s come to the point where it’s been a distraction. I feel mentally exhausted even if I haven’t put in much effort for the day. These characteristics sadly get in the way, and being a full-time student it’s a daily thing.   I really want to go the correct route, but with my lack of motivation and my careless errors sometimes it feels like my future may go in the wrong direction.

In this pilot study, we used β-AR 1 protein levels in PBMC as a marker for developing depressive symptoms and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores to assess potential mood-related side effects of oral contraceptive use for routine birth control among women. We evaluated 29 women in this study. We enrolled the participants in three groups: Estrogen-progestin combination-oral contraceptives (COC, *n* = 10), progestin-only contraceptives (POC, *n* = 12), and non-hormonal or no contraceptives (NC, *n* = 7). We determined the β-AR 1 protein levels in PBMCs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that women in the POC group had significantly higher HAM-D scores compared to those in the COC (*p* &lt; 0.0004) and NC (*p* &lt; 0.004). The levels of β-AR 1 protein were significantly attenuated in women in the POC group compared to women in the NC group (*p* = 0.03). **Our findings suggest that the use of POC is a potential risk factor for developing depressive symptoms.**  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139599/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139599/)  **Effects of hormonal contraceptives on emotion**  Reports on OC-related mood changes are inconsistent, ranging from beneficial in most women (Oinonen and Mazmanian, [2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139599/#B28)) to increased rates of depression,  , fatigue, neurotic symptoms, compulsion and anger (Robinson et al., [2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139599/#B64); Kulkarni, [2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139599/#B20)). Repeated findings of beneficial mood changes may however be biased by data sampling.

I’ve had a lot of little screw ups and my   has gotten the better of me at times when I’ve felt overwhelmed, but I feel I’m finally getting the hang of it.  My office is nice but I also know they’ve noticed the times I’ve messed up. I have about two months left to really leave a good impression before leaving to secure a recommendation/good reference, but I know I’ve already developed a reputation for being hard working but scatterbrained.  I want to continue this internship with some added responsibilities in the summer, and I know that I will only continue to get better and grow in the role. As of now I’m set to end in May. I mentioned it to a couple superiors and they seemed open but non committed the idea.  I’ve never let my   limit me and Ive never told any employer I have it. However, I’d want to tell my superior about how it just takes me a long time to master some organizational things—longer than others, and if given the chance I can really grow in the role. I’d really like to stick to this internship rather than moving to something new (again) because I just want the chance to really become proficient in a set of skills rather than always jumping to the next step, as we often are guided to when we’re young.

Increased the  dose to where it worked best, 20 mg twice daily. However, as soon as I  got up to that dose, I noticed that during the day when being physically  active I could feel my heart pounding in my chest quite heavily and  also an increased heart rate/ being out of breath. Now, Im no athlete,  but I do jog 5 miles normally without issue and this happened to me  after I ran for the bus.  I particularly  blame the meds. When I was on a intense hike I experienced the same  symptoms - heavy heartbeat, feeling it in my chest but also feeling my  pulse in my legs and my neck, really short of breath. I thought I had  just over estimated my abilities but my friend layed a heart on my chest  and also said this could not be normal. We continued little by little  (I could not walk for longer than 30 seconds) to get to a house, but  exactly at 13.30h, about when my meds should have stopped working, the  symptoms stopped completly and I felt much better. We finished the hike  with no further problems (and it actually got more intense, still no  problem). I found the same to be true in other exercise situations.  However, my doctors completly dismiss the issue and insist this cant be caused by the Medikinet. They also were weirdly chill about these issues, and said it was probably just because I was focussing on it. This seems highly unlikely to me.
